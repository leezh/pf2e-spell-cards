The weapon flies to its new target.</li> <li><strong>Strike</strong> (attack) The weapon attacks its target using your spell attack roll.

When you Cast or Sustain the spell, you can choose from the following options in addition to the standard ones.</p> <li><strong>Guard</strong> Rather than attacking, the weapon grants a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against melee attacks to the creature it's following. The bonus lasts until the start of your next turn or until the weapon Changes Partners, whichever comes first.</li> <li><strong>Push</strong> (attack) The weapon attempts to Push its target, using your spell attack roll instead of an Athletics check to determine the results of the Push.</li>\n"}, {"actions": "[three-actions]", "bloodline": [], "copyright": "2023 Paizo Inc.", "domain": [], "id": "spell-1385", "legacy": false, "lesson": [], "level": 7, "mystery": [], "patron": [], "rarity": "Common", "remaster": true, "source": "Pathfinder Rage of Elements", "title": "Dancing Fountain", "traditions": ["Arcane", "Primal"], "traits": ["Concentrate", "Manipulate", "Water"], "type": "Spell", "description": "<p class=\"hanging-indent traditions\"><strong>Traditions</strong> arcane, primal</p> <p class=\"hanging-indent area\"><strong>Area</strong> 30-foot burst centered on you</p> <p class=\"hanging-indent duration\"><strong>Duration</strong> sustained up to 1 minute</p> <hr/> <p>Tapping the ground, you create a shallow pool of water that spreads over the affected area, and majestic sprays, jets, and mists of water erupt forth in a dazzling water show.

While the soul is in the item, the target can't be returned to life through any means, even powerful magic such as a <em>wish</em> ritual. If the item is destroyed or seize soul is counteracted on the item, the soul is freed. An item can't hold more than one soul, and any attempt wastes the spell.</p> <p>You can also target an item that has had a soul trapped it in with a second casting of <em>seize soul</em>, which destroys the item and either releases the soul or relocates it to a different item, whichever you choose. This fails if the target is an artifact or the trapped soul is a creature of 19th level or higher.</p>\n"}, {"actions": "[three-actions]", "bloodline": [], "copyright": "2023 Paizo Inc.", "domain": [], "id": "spell-1665", "legacy": false, "lesson": [], "level": 5, "mystery": [], "patron": [], "rarity": "Common", "remaster": true, "source": "Pathfinder Player Core", "title": "Sending", "traditions": ["Arcane", "Divine", "Occult"], "traits": ["Concentrate", "Manipulate", "Mental"], "type": "Spell", "description": "<p class=\"hanging-indent traditions\"><strong>Traditions</strong> arcane, divine, occult</p> <p class=\"hanging-indent range\"><strong>Range</strong> planetary; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 creature you know well</p> <hr/> <p>You send the creature a mental message of 25 words or fewer, and it can respond immediately with its own message of 25 words or fewer.</p>\n"}, {"actions": "[three-actions]", "bloodline": [], "copyright": "2019 Paizo Inc.", "domain": [], "id": "spell-272", "legacy": true, "lesson": [], "level": 5, "mystery": [], "patron": [], "rarity": "Common", "remaster": false, "source": "Pathfinder Core Rulebook", "title": "Sending", "traditions": ["Arcane", "Divine", "Occult"], "traits": ["Divination", "Mental"], "type": "Spell", "description": "<p class=\"hanging-indent traditions\"><strong>Traditions</strong> arcane, divine, occult</p> <p class=\"hanging-indent cast\"><strong>Cast</strong> material, somatic, verbal</p> <p class=\"hanging-indent range\"><strong>Range</strong> planetary; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 creature with whom you are familiar</p> <hr/> <p>You send the creature a mental message of 25 words or fewer, and it can respond immediately with its own message of 25 words or fewer.</p>\n"}, {"actions": "[two-actions]", "bloodline": ["Psychopomp"], "copyright": "2020 Paizo Inc.", "domain": [], "id": "spell-786", "legacy": true, "lesson": [], "level": 1, "mystery": [], "patron": [], "rarity": "Uncommon", "remaster": false, "source": "Pathfinder Advanced Player's Guide", "title": "Sepulchral Mask", "traditions": [], "traits": ["Divination", "Emotion", "Focus", "Mental", "Sorcerer", "Visual"], "type": "Focus", "description": "<p class=\"hanging-indent bloodline\"><strong>Bloodline</strong> psychopomp</p> <p class=\"hanging-indent cast\"><strong>Cast</strong> somatic, verbal</p> <p class=\"hanging-indent area\"><strong>Area</strong> 5-foot emanation; <strong>Targets</strong> enemies in the area</p> <p class=\"hanging-indent defense\"><strong>Defense</strong> Will; <strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute</p> <hr/> <p>You manifest a supernatural funerary mask, granting you a +1 status bonus to Will saving throws against emotion effects for 1 minute.

Each enemy in a 100-foot emanation takes 10d8 bludgeoning damage with a basic Fortitude save; <strong>Depart</strong> (air) <em>Twister Downdraft</em> Each enemy in a 60-foot line must attempt a Fortitude save. A creature that fails is knocked prone if it's on the ground or descends 40 feet if it's in the air. A creature that descends takes falling damage if this forced movement brings it to the ground.</li> <li><strong>Earth</strong> Speed 50 feet, burrow 30 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> (earth) <em>Tectonic Rise</em> The herald of earth erupts from the ground, splitting it open in a 50-foot emanation. Each enemy in the emanation takes 10d6 slashing damage from the flying debris with a basic Reflex save. Enemies who critically fail fall 30 feet into the crevasse, taking falling damage (the sides of the fissure require successful DC 15 Athletics checks to Climb); <strong>Depart</strong> (sonic) <em>Plate Crash</em> The herald of earth sinks back into the ground, and the sides of the crevasse slam together with a deafening blow, dealing 5d10 sonic damage with a basic Fortitude save to all enemies in a 30-foot emanation. An enemy that critically fails is deafened for 10 minutes.</li> <li><strong>Fire</strong> Speed 60 feet, fly 40 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> (fire) <em>Magma Flow</em> The herald of fire flows into the area as living magma, dealing 10d6 fire damage and 3d6 persistent fire damage to all enemies in a 60-foot emanation with a basic Reflex save; <strong>Depart</strong> (fire) <em>Flame Vortex</em> Each enemy in a 60-foot line takes 6d6 fire damage and 3d6 persistent fire damage with a basic Reflex save as the fire herald whips into a fire pillar before vanishing.</li> <li><strong>Metal</strong> Speed 50 feet, fly 50 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> (metal) <em>Shard Cloud</em> The herald of metal arrives as a cloud of metal shards and static electricity, dealing 4d8 slashing damage and 4d12 electricity damage to all enemies in a 50-foot emanation with a basic Reflex save; <strong>Depart</strong> (metal) <em>Rust Mist</em> The shards in the cloud rapidly rust and cling to enemies in the 50-foot emanation, dealing 10d6 damage to metal creatures and objects in the area with a basic Reflex save, ignoring Hardness. Unattended objects automatically critically fail this save.</li> <li><strong>Water</strong> Speed 40 feet, swim 60 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> (cold, water) <em>Hurricane Formation</em> The herald of water forms as a miniature hurricane. Each enemy in a 60-foot emanation takes 4d10 bludgeoning damage from the slamming rains and 4d10 cold damage from the falling hail with a basic Fortitude save; <strong>Depart</strong> (cold, water) <em>Cataclysmic Deluge</em> The hurricane collapses into a rushing flood, dealing 6d8 bludgeoning damage to all enemies in a 120-foot cone with a basic Fortitude save. A creature that fails its save is pushed 20 feet away from the herald (or 40 feet on a critical failure).</li> <li><strong>Wood</strong> Speed 50 feet, burrow 30 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> (plant, wood) <em>Advantageous Roots</em> The herald of wood bursts forth from the ground as a complex root system. Each enemy in a 50-foot emanation takes 6d10 piercing damage with a basic Reflex save as the roots skewer its limbs and body.

Only one creature can share its vision at a time, so if another target takes this action, the effect ends for any target that was previously sharing its vision.</p> <p>This improves how well the recipients can perceive anything the sharing creature is looking at.

Typically, the creature is seen as a glowing outline superimposed on its position. This might allow the recipient to target a creature it couldn't otherwise; however, cover and line of effect still might prevent or impede targeting and attacks. This can only improve the recipient's vision, not reduce it; for example, if an enemy was undetected by the sharing creature and observed by a recipient, the recipient would still clearly observe the enemy.</p> <p>Once the vision sharing stops, the benefit ends.
