  <p>Giving a cheerful whistle, you call forth a handful of small animals, such as birds or mice, to collect food for you and your allies. The animals return 1 hour later with enough foraged goods to feed four Medium creatures for 1 day, then return to their normal behavior. If you’re in a particularly strange environment, as determined by your GM, you might need a minimum proficiency with primal spell DCs, equivalent to the minimum proficiency required to Subsist in strange environments.</p>
