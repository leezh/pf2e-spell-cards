  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> 30 feet; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 creature</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent defense"><strong>Defense</strong> Will; <strong>Duration</strong> sustained up to 1 minute</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>With a cruel laugh and a flash of your canines, you make a target understand that death is coming to claim it and that its demise will serve to strengthen another. The target becomes frightened 1 if it fails a Will save (or frightened 2 on a critical failure). This condition can't be reduced below 1 while the spell is active and the target can hear you. You can Dismiss the spell as a reaction when an ally critically succeeds at a Strike against the target, restoring 1d4 Hit Points to that ally.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> The number of Hit Points restored when you Dismiss the spell increases by 1d4.</p>
