  <p class="hanging-indent defense"><strong>Defense</strong> Fortitude; <strong>Duration</strong> sustained up to 1 minute</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>A long tentacle like that belonging to an octopus, anemone, or man-of-war, dripping with briny water, appears from a glowing blue portal to wrap around the target’s face, blocking its vision. For the duration of the spell, the target must attempt a Fortitude save at the beginning of its turn. The portal follows the target around, and the tentacle can’t be targeted or harmed.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The target takes a –2 penalty to Perception checks involving vision until the end of its turn.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> The target is dazzled until the end of its turn.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The target is blinded until the end of its turn.</p>
