  <p>You give an unsettling, warbling cry that causes nearby creatures to lash out without control. Each creature in the area that can hear must attempt a Will save.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected and immune to this spell for 1 minute.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The target is stunned 1.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> The target is confused for 1 minute. It can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns to end the confusion.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, and the creature immediately attacks itself. This Strike doesn’t give the creature a flat check to recover from the confusion.</p>
