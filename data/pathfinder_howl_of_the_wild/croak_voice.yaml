  <p class="hanging-indent traditions"><strong>Traditions</strong> arcane, primal</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> 30 feet; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 creature</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent defense"><strong>Defense</strong> Fortitude; <strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You cause the target creature’s vocal chords to swell like those of a frog. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The target's voice becomes hoarse, and speaking becomes painful. Whenever it uses an action that has the auditory trait or attempts to Cast a Spell that doesn't have the subtle trait, it must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the action is lost. Once per round, the target can spend an Interact action to massage its throat, attempting a Fortitude save against your spell DC. On a success, the spell ends.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> As success, but using an action with the auditory trait also deals 2d10 mental damage to the target as the sound of its distorted voice grates on its ears.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the damage for using an action with the auditory trait is doubled, and the target can't use an Interact action to attempt a Fortitude save to end the effect early.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage for using an action with the auditory trait increases by 1d10.</p>
