  <p class="hanging-indent area"><strong>Area</strong> 15-foot cone; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 creature within reach</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent defense"><strong>Defense</strong> AC and basic Fortitude (see text)</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>Imitating raptorial creatures, you attack with such speed it drives a sonic shockwave. Make a melee Strike against a creature in your reach; if you hit, you deal an additional 3d8 sonic damage. Regardless of the result of your Strike, that creature becomes the point of origin of a 15-foot cone, aimed directly away from you. All creatures in that cone take 6d8 sonic damage (basic Fortitude save).</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage of the cone increases by 1d8.</p>
