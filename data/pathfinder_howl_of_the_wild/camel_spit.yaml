  <p class="hanging-indent defense"><strong>Defense</strong> AC; <strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You alter your stomach, esophagus, and tongue to be able to spit partially digested food with force. You can spit at a foe once you finish Casting the Spell and can repeat the attack once on each of your subsequent turns by taking a single action, which has the acid, attack, and concentrate traits. After your third spit attack, the spell ends.</p>
  <p>When you attack with camel spit, make a ranged spell attack roll against a creature within 15 feet, dealing 1d6 acid damage and causing the target to be dazzled for 1 round if you hit. On a critical hit, you deal double damage and the target takes 1 persistent acid damage.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by 1d6, and the persistent damage on a critical hit is increased by 1.</p>
