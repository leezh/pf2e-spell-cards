  <p class="hanging-indent traditions"><strong>Traditions</strong> primal</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> 120 feet; <strong>Targets</strong> up to 5 creatures; <strong>Area</strong> 500-foot burst</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent duration"><strong>Duration</strong> 10 minutes</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>Animals, plants, and fungi in the area turn against the targets. Each target suffers from the following effects as long as it remains in the area.</p>
  <li>Vegetation springs up from every surface, giving each target a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speed any time it's adjacent to the plants and fungi.</li>
  <li>Aggressive animals attack unpredictably. At the start of its turn, each target rolls a DC 8 flat check. On a failure, it's attacked by creatures that deal 2d10 slashing damage. The target attempts a basic Reflex save and is off-guard for 1 round on any outcome other than a critical success.</li>
  <li>The target loses any connection to nature or natural creatures. The target must succeed at a DC 5 flat check when casting any primal spell or the spell fails. Furthermore, animal, fungus, and plant creatures become hostile to it, even one with a strong bond to the target, such as an animal companion.</li>
  <p>The GM might decide that you can't subject some creatures, such as an emissary of a nature deity, to the ire of nature.</p>
