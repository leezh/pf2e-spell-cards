  <hr/>
  <p>You utter a powerful secret at odds with the fundamental nature of the target creatures. Choose a specific resistance or weakness with a numerical value that you believe one or more of the targets have due to Recall Knowledge or previous experience with the targets, such as resistance to fire or weakness to silver. If the information is incorrect for a given target, the spell has no effect on that target. Affected targets must attempt a Will saving throw.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>
  <p><strong>Success</strong> The creature takes 1 damage that matches the type or trait of weakness you chose (thus triggering the creature's weakness) if you chose a weakness, or loses its resistance until the end of your next turn if you chose a resistance.</p>
  <p><strong>Failure</strong> As success, and the creature becomes frightened 1 from the revelation of its dread secret.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, except the creature is frightened 3.</p>
