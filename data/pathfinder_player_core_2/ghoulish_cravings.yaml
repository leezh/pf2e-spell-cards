  <p>You touch the target to afflict it with the overwhelming desire to eat raw meat. The target must attempt a Will save.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The target is sickened 1 by its unbidden hunger.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> The target is sickened 2 and can't reduce this condition below sickened 1 until it first consumes some raw meat; if the creature doesn't have access to raw meat, it can take a bite out of a corpse within reach as an Interact action.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the target can't reduce the condition below sickened 2 until it consumes raw meat.</p>
