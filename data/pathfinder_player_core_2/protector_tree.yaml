  <p class="range"><strong>Range</strong> 30 feet</p>
  <p class="duration"><strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>A Medium tree suddenly grows in an unoccupied square within range. The tree has AC 10 and 10 Hit Points. Whenever an ally adjacent to the tree is hit by a Strike, the tree interposes its branches and takes the damage first. Any additional damage beyond what it takes to reduce the tree to 0 Hit Points is dealt to the original target. The tree isn't large enough to impede movement through its square.</p>
  <p>If the tree is in soil and survives to the end of the spell's duration, it remains as an ordinary, non-magical tree and continues to grow and thrive. The GM might determine that the tree disappears immediately in certain inhospitable situations.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The tree has an additional 10 Hit Points.</p>
