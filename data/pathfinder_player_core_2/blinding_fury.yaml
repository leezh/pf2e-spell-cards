  <p>You curse the target with your outrage at being attacked. The effect is determined by the target's Will save.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
  <p><strong>Success</strong> The target can't observe you until the end of its turn, and if you're currently observed by it, you become hidden to it.</p>
  <p><strong>Failure</strong> As success, and for 1 minute, every time the target damages you, it can't observe you until the end of its turn.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As success, and for an unlimited duration, the first time each round the target damages a creature, it can't observe that creature until the end of its turn. If it damages several creatures at once, the creature it can't perceive is chosen randomly among those creatures.</p>
