  <p>You take on the stance of the flowing winds, sending out waves of energy at a distance. You can make wind crash unarmed Strikes as ranged Strikes against targets within 30 feet. These deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the agile, nonlethal, propulsive, and unarmed traits. Wind crash Strikes ignore concealment and all cover.</p>
  <p>While in wild winds stance, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against ranged attacks.</p>
