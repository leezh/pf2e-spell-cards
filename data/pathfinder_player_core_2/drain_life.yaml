You gain temporary Hit Points equal to the damage the target takes, after resolving its save and applying a blood magic effect if applicable. If the target's Hit Points were lower than the damage you dealt, you gain temporary Hit Points equal to their remaining Hit Points instead. The temporary Hit Points last for 1 minute.</p>
