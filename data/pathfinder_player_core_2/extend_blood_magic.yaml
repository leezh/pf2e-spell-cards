  <hr/>
  <p>You call upon the arcane energy coursing through your blood to extend the magic it grants. If your next action is to Cast a Spell that grants you a blood magic effect that lasts for at least 1 round, you or a target gain the blood magic effect for an additional round. You can have only one extended blood magic effect at a time.</p>
