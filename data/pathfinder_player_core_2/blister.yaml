  <p>You point at a target in range, and its skin grows searing blisters filled with caustic fluid. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
  <p><strong>Success</strong> The target grows one blister. You can spend a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to pop a blister.

When no blisters are left, the spell ends.</p>
