  <hr/>
  <p>Make a melee unarmed Strike. If you hit and the target is alive, anytime during the duration, you can spend a single action, which has the auditory and concentrate traits, to speak a word of death that could instantly slay it. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target survives, the spell ends, and the target is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.</p>
  <p><strong>Success</strong> The target is stunned 1 and takes 40 damage, the spell ends, and the target is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.</p>
  <p><strong>Failure</strong> The target is stunned 3 and takes 80 damage. The spell's duration continues, but the target is then temporarily immune for 24 hours against being killed by <em>touch of death</em>.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The target dies.</p>
  <p>If you cast <em>touch of death</em> again, the effects of any <em>touch of death</em> you had previously cast end.</p>
