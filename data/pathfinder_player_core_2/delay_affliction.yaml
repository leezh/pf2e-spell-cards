  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> 30 feet; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 creature</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>With a surge of healing energy, you push back against an affliction threatening the target and grant a small amount of healing. The target recovers 3d8 Hit Points. You attempt to counteract any one affliction you are aware the target has, suspending its effects for 1 hour on a success rather than removing it. The target is then temporarily immune to <em>delay affliction</em> for 1 day. You don't need to have identified the name of the specific affliction, but you do need to be aware of it; for instance, you couldn't delay an ingested poison during its onset period unless you were aware of the poison.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The target recovers an additional 1d8 Hit Points, and you can attempt to suspend an additional affliction.</p>
