  <p class="trigger"><strong>Trigger</strong> An attack would bring you to 0 Hit Points.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You shout in defiance and are filled with a burst of healing. Just before applying the attack's damage, you recover 6d8+20 Hit Points. If this is enough to prevent the attack from bringing you to 0 Hit Points, you don't become unconscious or dying. Either way, cheating death is difficult, and you can't use <em>hero's defiance</em> again until you Refocus or make your daily preparations. <em>Hero's defiance</em> can't be used against effects with the death trait or that would leave no remains, such as <em>disintegrate</em>.</p>
