  <p class="mystery"><strong>Mystery</strong> bones</p>
  <p class="range"><strong>Range</strong> 30 feet; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 undead creature</p>
  <p class="defense"><strong>Defense</strong> Will; <strong>Duration</strong> 10 minutes</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You attempt to wrest control of a target undead or force it to recognize you as its master. If the target is controlled by another creature, that controller attempts a Will saving throw to retain control; otherwise, the target must attempt a Will save.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
  <p><strong>Success</strong> The target is stunned 1 and confused for 1 round as it fights off your commands.</p>
  <p><strong>Failure</strong> The target becomes controlled by you and follows your orders. It (or the creature previously controlling it) can attempt a new Will save at the end of each of its turns; on a success, the spell ends, and the creature becomes stunned 1 and confused for 1 round. If you issue an obviously self-destructive order, the target doesn't act until you issue a new order.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the target (or the creature previously controlling it) receives a new save only if you give it a new order that is against its nature.</p>
