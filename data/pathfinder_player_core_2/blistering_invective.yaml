  <p class="defense"><strong>Defense</strong> Will</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>A heap of insults and invectives spew from your mouthâ€”words so devastating your foes burn from the intensity of your diatribe. Your words deal 2d6 persistent fire damage, and the target must attempt a Will save. If the target doesn't understand the language or you're not speaking a language, it gains a +4 circumstance bonus to its save.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
  <p><strong>Success</strong> The target takes half the persistent fire damage.</p>
  <p><strong>Failure</strong> The target becomes frightened 1 and takes the full persistent fire damage.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The target becomes frightened 2 and takes double the persistent fire damage.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> You can target two additional creatures, and the persistent damage increases by 2d6.</p>
