  <p class="hanging-indent defense"><strong>Defense</strong> Will; <strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You instill within a creature the touch of the grave. For the duration, <em>harm</em> and <em>heal</em> spells treat the creature as undead. In addition, <em>harm</em> spells gain a +2 status bonus to the Hit Points restored to the target. An unwilling target can attempt a Will save to reduce the effects.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The target heals half as much from <em>heal</em> and takes half as much damage from <em>harm</em> for 1 round.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> Effects as described above.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The status bonus to the Hit Points restored increases by 2.</p>
