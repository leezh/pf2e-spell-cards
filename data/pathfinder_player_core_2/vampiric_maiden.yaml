  <p class="hanging-indent traditions"><strong>Traditions</strong> arcane, divine, occult</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> 30 feet; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 creature</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent defense"><strong>Defense</strong> Fortitude</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>A ghostly iron maiden snaps shut on the target and drains its vitality for your gain. This deals 4d4 piercing damage and 4d4 void damage, and the target must attempt a Fortitude save. You gain temporary Hit Points equal to the void damage the target takes (after applying resistances, weaknesses, and the like). You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The target takes half damage.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> The target is briefly trapped within the vampiric maiden. The target takes full damage and is immobilized by the iron maiden for 1 round or until it uses an Interact action to extricate itself, whichever comes first.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The target takes double damage and is immobilized by the vampiric maiden for 1 round or until it Escapes (the DC is your spell DC), whichever comes first.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The piercing and void damage increase by 1d4 each.</p>
