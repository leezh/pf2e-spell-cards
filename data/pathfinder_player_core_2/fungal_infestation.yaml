  <p class="hanging-indent defense"><strong>Defense</strong> Fortitude</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>Toxic spores swarm over creatures in the area, causing them to erupt in grotesque fungal growths. These noxious growths deal 2d6 persistent poison damage, and each creature must attempt a Fortitude save.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The target takes half the persistent poison damage.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> The target takes the full persistent poison damage. While it's taking this persistent poison damage, it has weakness 1 to fire and weakness 1 to slashing.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but double the persistent poison damage. While it's taking this persistent poison damage, it has weakness 2 to fire and weakness 2 to slashing.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> The persistent damage increases by 2d6, and the weakness increases by 1, or by 2 on a critical failure.</p>
