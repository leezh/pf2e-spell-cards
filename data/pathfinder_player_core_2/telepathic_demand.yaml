  <p class="range"><strong>Range</strong> planetary; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 creature youâ€™ve telepathically contacted before</p>
  <p class="defense"><strong>Defense</strong> Will; <strong>Duration</strong> varies</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You send the target a message of 25 words or fewer, and it can respond immediately with its own message of 25 words or fewer. Your message is insidious and has the effect of a <em>suggestion</em> spell, with the message substituting for the spoken suggestion. On a successful save, the target is temporarily immune for 1 day, and on a critical success, the target is temporarily immune for 1 month. You can target a creature only if you've previously been in telepathic contact with it before, such as via the <em>telepathy</em> spell.</p>
