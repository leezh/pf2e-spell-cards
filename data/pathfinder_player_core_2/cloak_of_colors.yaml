  <p>A cloak of swirling colors shrouds the target. Creatures are dazzled while adjacent to it, and attacking the target causes a brilliant flash of light. A creature that hits the target with a melee attack must attempt a Will save. The creature is then temporarily immune until the end of its turn; this effect has the incapacitation trait.</p>
  <p><strong>Success</strong> The attacker is unaffected.</p>
  <p><strong>Failure</strong> The attacker is blinded for 1 round.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The attacker is stunned for 1 round.</p>
