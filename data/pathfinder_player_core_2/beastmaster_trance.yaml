  <p class="range"><strong>Range</strong> 1 mile; <strong>Targets</strong> one animal companion you can perceive</p>
  <p class="duration"><strong>Duration</strong> sustained up to 1 minute</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You enter a trance that allows you to see through the senses of the target companion. You attempt Perception checks using your own Perception, but you share special senses the target has, such as low-light vision. This spell grants no special method of communication with the chosen animal.</p>
  <p>For the duration of the trance, your own senses are muted. This lack of awareness makes you off-guard. You can't take actions with the attack or move traits.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Heightened (6th)</strong> Increase the range to 100 miles and the duration of sustained up to 10 minutes. The target can hear you through the spell, allowing you to Command the Animal or use other actions that have the auditory trait.</p>
  <p><strong>Heightened (8th)</strong> Increase the range to planetary and the duration of sustained up to 1 hour. You can communicate telepathically with the target for the duration of the trance.</p>
