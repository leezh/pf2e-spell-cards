  <li>Due to the distraction, the target must succeed at a DC 5 flat check each time it uses a concentrate action, or the action fails and is wasted.</li>
  <li>The target's difficulty processing visual input makes all creatures and objects concealed from it.</li>
  <li>The creature has trouble moving, making it clumsy 3 and giving it a –10-foot status penalty to its Speeds.</li>
