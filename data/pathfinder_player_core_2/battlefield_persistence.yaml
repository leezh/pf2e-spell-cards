  <p class="hanging-indent trigger"><strong>Trigger</strong> You are about to attempt a saving throw, but you haven’t rolled yet.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You're difficult to deter in battle. You gain a +2 status bonus to the triggering save, and if the triggering save is against an incapacitation effect, it treats you as if you were 2 levels higher.</p>
