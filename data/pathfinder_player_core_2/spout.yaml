  <p class="range"><strong>Range</strong> 30 feet; <strong>Area</strong> a 5-foot cube</p>
  <p class="defense"><strong>Defense</strong> basic Reflex</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>Water blasts upward, coming out of the ground, rising from a pool, or even manifesting from thin air. Any creatures in the area take 2d4 bludgeoning damage, with a basic Reflex saving throw. A creature that critically fails its save is disoriented by the explosion of water, becoming off-guard until the end of your next turn.</p>
  <p>You can change this spell's area to a 5-foot burst, provided you center the burst in a body of water. This body of water can be as small as a pond or creek, but not as small as a puddle or bathtub.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by 1d4.</p>
