  <hr/>
  <p>The memories of long-dead spellcasters grant you their knowledge, making your spells more formidable. You gain either a +1 status bonus to the next spell attack roll you attempt before the end of your turn or an enemy within 60 feet takes a –1 status penalty to the next saving throw they attempt against a spell you cast before the end of your turn.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (5th)</strong> The bonus increases to +2 or the penalty increases to –2.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (8th)</strong> The bonus increases to +3 or the penalty increases to –3.</p>
