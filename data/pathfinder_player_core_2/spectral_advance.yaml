  <p>Taking on a spiritual form, you flash across the battlefield to engage an enemy. You Stride to a space adjacent to an enemy. If you cast the spell using 2 actions, you can Stride twice instead of once. If you have a fly Speed, you can Fly instead of Striding. If you're mounted, you can have your mount move instead of you. Movement from <em>spectral advance</em> doesn't trigger reactions and ignores difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain. During the movement, you (or your mount) have resistance equal to your level to all damage.</p>
