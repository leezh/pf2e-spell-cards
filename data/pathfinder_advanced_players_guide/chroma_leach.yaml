  <p class="hanging-indent cast"><strong>Cast</strong> somatic, verbal</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> touch; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 living creature</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent defense"><strong>Defense</strong> Fortitude</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>Your hand glows with impossible colors from beyond the stars, and your touch saps both color and vitality from the living. The target must attempt a Fortitude save; creatures with the gnome trait take a –2 circumstance penalty to this save.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The target is enfeebled 2 for 1 round.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> The target is enfeebled 2 for 1 minute and drained 1. The target is also filled with listlessness and ennui. For 1 round, if the target tries to use a move action, it must succeed at a Will save against your spell DC or the action is lost; this effect has the mental and emotion traits.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the creature is permanently enfeebled 2 and drained 2 (although magic such as <em>restoration</em> can reduce or remove these conditions).</p>
