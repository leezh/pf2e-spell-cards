  <p>You gain the ability to perform a specialized combat technique from the vast wealth of martial knowledge your mystery provides. When you Cast this Spell, you use the action granted by one common fighter feat from the <em>Core Rulebook</em> or the <em>Advanced Player's Guide</em> (your GM might add feats to this list). If you Cast this Spell using 2 actions, the granted action must be a single action, and if you Cast this Spell using 3 actions, you can instead choose a feat that grants a 2-action activity. The chosen feat's level can be no higher than <em>heroic feat's</em> spell level. The feat can't have a Frequency entry, and you must meet its prerequisites and requirements in order to select it.</p>
