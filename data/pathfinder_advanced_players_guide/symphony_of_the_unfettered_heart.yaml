Attempt a Performance check to counteract one of the following conditions affecting the target: grabbed, immobilized, paralyzed, restrained, slowed, or stunned. If you fail, you can't target that effect on the target for 1 day. Use the condition's source to determine the counteract DC (for example, the Escape DC for grabbed).</p>
