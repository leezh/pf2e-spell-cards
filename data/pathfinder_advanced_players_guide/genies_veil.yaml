  <p>With a flourish, you fulfill a creature's wish for protection, bending reality to keep them from harm. The target vanishes in a burst of brightly colored smoke and sparkles, reappearing an instant later. They become concealed against the triggering attack and until the end of the current creature's turn.</p>
