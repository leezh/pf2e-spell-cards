  <p>You transcend your physical form, becoming a beacon of healing energy. Your body exudes bright light like a torch. You gain resistance 5 to precision damage and weakness 5 to negative damage, and your unarmed Strikes deal an extra 1d4 positive damage.</p>
  <p>You can touch a living creature with an Interact action to restore 6d8 Hit Points to it, and when a creature touches you with an Interact action you can allow it to gain the same healing; either way, the creature becomes temporarily immune to <em>life-giving form's</em> healing for 1 minute. This is a positive healing effect. You can't heal yourself with <em>life-giving form</em>. A creature harmed by positive damage (such as an undead) that touches you or damages you with an unarmed attack or non-reach melee weapon instead takes 3d4 positive damage, and it doesn't become temporarily immune.</p>
  <p>You can Dismiss this spell.</p>

  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> Increase the Hit Points restored with an Interact action by 1d8, the positive damage by 1, and the resistance and weakness by 1.</p>
