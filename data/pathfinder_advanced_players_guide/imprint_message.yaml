  <p>You project psychic vibrations onto the target object, imprinting it with a short message or emotional theme of your design. This imprinted sensation is revealed to a creature who casts <em>object reading</em> on the target object, replacing any emotional events the item was present for. If the object is in the area of a <em>retrocognition</em> spell, the imprinted messages appear as major events in the timeline, but they don't interfere with any other visions.</p>
  <p>If the object is targeted with <em>read aura</em> of a higher spell level than <em>imprint message</em>, the caster learns that the object has been magically modified. When you Cast this Spell, any prior vibrations placed on an object by previous castings of <em>imprint message</em> fade.</p>
