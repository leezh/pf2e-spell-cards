  <p class="hanging-indent traditions"><strong>Traditions</strong> arcane, occult</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent cast"><strong>Cast</strong> somatic, verbal</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> 100 feet; <strong>Targets</strong> up to 50 feet of rope or a nonliving rope-like object</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent duration"><strong>Duration</strong> sustained up to 1 minute</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You cause a length or section of rope or a rope-like object to animate and follow simple commands. You can give it two commands when you Cast the Spell, and one command each time you Sustain the Spell.</p>
  <li><strong>Bind</strong> (attack) The rope attempts to partially bind a creature. Attempt a spell attack roll against the target's Reflex DC. If you succeed, the target takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speed (–20-foot on a critical success). This ends if the target Escapes against your spell DC or breaks the rope. (A standard adventuring rope has Hardness 2, HP 8, and a Broken Threshold of 4.)</li>
  <li><strong>Coil</strong> The rope forms a tidy, coiled stack.</li>
  <li><strong>Crawl</strong> The rope inches along the ground like a snake, moving one of its ends 10 feet. The rope must move along a surface, but that surface doesn't need to be horizontal.</li>
  <li><strong>Knot</strong> The rope ties a sturdy knot in itself.</li>
  <li><strong>Loop</strong> The rope forms a simple loop at one or both ends, or straightens itself back out.</li>
  <li><strong>Tie</strong> The rope ties itself around a willing creature or an object that's unattended or attended by a willing creature.</li>
  <li><strong>Undo</strong> The rope undoes one of its knots, ties, or bindings.</li>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> The range increases by 50 feet, and you can animate 50 more feet of rope.</p>
