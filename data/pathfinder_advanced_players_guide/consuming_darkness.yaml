  <p>Your shadow wriggles before spreading out from you, forming a gateway of clinging, consuming shadow through which the horrors of another plane can barely be seen. The first time each turn you Sustain the Spell, the radius increases by 5 feet. Each enemy that enters the area or begins its turn in the area takes 2d6 negative damage and must attempt a Reflex save.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The creature sinks partially into the shadow, taking half damage and a –5-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for as long it remains in the area.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> As success, but the creature takes full damage and a –10-foot circumstance penalty.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature is absorbed into the shadows, where it can be seen below the surface; it takes double damage and is immobilized for 1 round or until it Escapes.</p>
