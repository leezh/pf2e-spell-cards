Each creature within the emanation must attempt a Will save when you Cast the Spell or the first time they enter the area, after which they become temporarily immune for 1 day. Once per turn, you can spend a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to increase the emanation's radius by 5 feet. You can Dismiss the spell.</p>
