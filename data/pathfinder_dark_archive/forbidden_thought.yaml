  <p>You place a psychic lock in a foe's mind that prevents it from a specific action. Choose “Strike,” “Stride,” “Cast a Spell,” or a specific action you know the creature to have (such as “Breath Weapon” against a dragon). If the creature attempts that action on its next turn, it must surmount your lock to do so, causing it to take 2d6 mental damage (with a basic Will save). The target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.</p>

  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by 1d6.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Amp</strong> Your telepathic push is particularly shocking to those who resist it. If the target fails its save, it's also stunned 1.</p>
