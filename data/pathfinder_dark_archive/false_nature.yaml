  <p>You create an illusion that makes an object seem to be something entirely different. When you Cast this Spell, speak aloud a declarative statement that the target is a different, nonspecific object. Your statement can't presuppose any other facts. For instance, you could claim an object is “a stone” or “an antidote,” but not “the <em>Starstone</em>” or “the antidote to the lethal poison you already drank.” Creatures who previously observed the target receive an immediate Will save to disbelieve, but on a failure, the illusion temporarily rewrites their memory that the object was something different. A creature who failed their Will save, or didn't already see the item's original form, must Interact with the illusion as normal to receive a Perception check against the spell DC to disbelieve. When the spell ends, targets remember the object's true nature, even if they never disbelieved the spell.</p>
