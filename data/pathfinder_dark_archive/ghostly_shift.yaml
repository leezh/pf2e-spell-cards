  <p class="hanging-indent duration"><strong>Duration</strong> sustained up to 1 minute</p>

  <p>Your body becomes insubstantial as you partially phase out. You gain resistance 2 to all damage (except force).</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> The resistance increases by 1.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Amp</strong> Your insubstantiality is complete enough that you can pass through other creatures, causing painful interference effects when you do so. Once each round when you Stride, Burrow, Swim, or Fly, you can pass through one creature's space during that action without needing to attempt a check to Tumble Through, though you can't end your turn in its space. When you pass through a creature's space in this way, you deal 2d6 force damage to that creature, with a basic Fortitude save.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Amp Heightened (+2)</strong> Increase the damage dealt by phasing through a creature by 1d6.</p>
