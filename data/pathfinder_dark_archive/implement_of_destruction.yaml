  <p class="hanging-indent traditions"><strong>Traditions</strong> divine, occult</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent cast"><strong>Cast</strong> somatic, verbal</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> 30 feet; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 enemy, and 1 weapon that is either unattended or wielded by you or a willing ally</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent defense"><strong>Defense</strong> Will; <strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You solemnly declare that the target weapon will bring death to a foe, implanting an irrational fear of the weapon into the target enemy. This link echoes at the forefront of the enemy's mind, forming a looming sense of omnipresent dread. The effect is based on the target enemy's Will save.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target enemy is unaffected.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The target weapon deals an additional 2d6 mental damage the first time it hits the target enemy before the end of the spell's duration.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> The target weapon deals an additional 2d6 persistent mental damage to the target enemy. If the enemy is critically hit by the weapon, the enemy is doomed 1 for as long as it takes this persistent mental damage.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The target weapon deals an additional 4d6 persistent mental damage to the target enemy. If the enemy is critically hit by the weapon, the enemy is doomed 1.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> Increase the mental damage by 1d6 on a success, and increase the persistent mental damage by 1d6 on a failure or by 2d6 on a critical failure.</p>
