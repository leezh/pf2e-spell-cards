  <p>You share some of your own temporal distortions with a foe, altering their mind and body unpredictably as they're thrown backward or forward in time. Roll 1d4. On a 1, the foe becomes clumsy; on a 2, it becomes enfeebled; on a 3, it becomes stupefied; and on a 4, you choose which condition applies.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is either clumsy 1, enfeebled 1, or stupefied 1 for 4 rounds, depending on the result of the d4.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the time warp is stronger, increasing the condition's effects but making it run its course faster. The condition's value is 3, and the condition lasts for 2 rounds.</p>
