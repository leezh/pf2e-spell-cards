  <hr/>
  <p>You cover the area in a sloshing torrent of semi-solidified thought, roughly ankle high. The area becomes difficult terrain, similarly to a shallow bog. Each round that a creature starts its turn in the area, it must attempt a Fortitude save against the shifting waves of thought. On a failure, it takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until it leaves the area, and on a critical failure, it is also knocked prone.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The radius of the spell's area increases by 5 feet.</p>
