  <p>You summon a tangible manifestation of loneliness to cloak the target from view as surely as if it were wreathed in darkness. The target attempts a Will saving throw.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The target becomes invisible, but only to its allies. Any creature not allied with the target can see it normally. Effects such as <em>see invisibility</em> enable an ally to see the target. The target's allies still know the target is present and can still see all the effects of the target's actions.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> As success, except the target also becomes inaudible to its allies and imperceptible to them through any other senses.</p>
