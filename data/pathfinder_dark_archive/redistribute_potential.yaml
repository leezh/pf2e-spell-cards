  <p class="hanging-indent cast"><strong>Cast</strong> somatic, verbal</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> 60 feet; <strong>Area</strong> 2 adjacent 5-foot squares</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent defense"><strong>Defense</strong> basic Fortitude</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>Energy attempts to balance out, but with your magic, you can shunt all the energy in one area to another. Creatures in either area take 4d4 damage with a basic Fortitude save. Choose one of the squares to steal heat, dealing cold damage, and the other to concentrate the stolen heat, dealing fire damage. A creature that fails its save also becomes clumsy 1 from numbness if it's in the area of stolen heat or enfeebled 1 from heat stroke if it's in the area of concentrated heat; these conditions last until the start of your next turn. If a creature is large enough to be in both squares, you choose only one of the areas for it to attempt its save against; it's unaffected by the other area.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by 1d4.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Amp</strong> You can affect the flow of energy on a much grander scale. Instead of two 5-foot squares, you create two 10-foot bursts. They still must be adjacent to one another and can overlap. A creature in both areas can still be affected by only one of your choice. The spell's damage increases to 6d6. The conditions last for 1 minute.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Amp Heightened (+1)</strong> Increase the damage by 2d6 instead of 1d4.</p>
