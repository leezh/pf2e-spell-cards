  <p class="hanging-indent cast"><strong>Cast</strong> somatic, verbal</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> 60 feet; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 creature</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent defense"><strong>Defense</strong> Will; <strong>Duration</strong> sustained up to 1 minute</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You cloud the target's mind with vivid, dreamlike imagery, so they have difficulty distinguishing real threats from imagined ones.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The target is distracted by the visions and treats all other creatures as concealed for 1 round, and you can't Sustain the Spell to increase the duration.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> The target is confused. In addition to the creatures present, the target might also attack wildly at thin air, attempting to fend off the dreams. It can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns to end the confusion. Even if the confused effect ends early, the target treats all other creatures as concealed for 1 round.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the target gets no save to end the effect early.</p>
