  <p>You point your finger and project a bolt of magical energy that stutters in and out of phase until it reaches the target. Make a ranged spell attack roll against your target's AC; if the target has any circumstance bonuses to AC (such as from a shield or cover), reduce that bonus by 2 for this attack. On a success, you deal 3d4 piercing damage. On a critical success, the target takes double damage.</p>

  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The bolt's damage increases by 1d4.</p>
