  <p>You sigh, and your breath transforms into delicate, black-winged butterflies and huge death's-head hawkmoths. They flutter about you briefly, and then range forth in search of sustenance— fresh-spilled blood, by preference, but rotting corpses, flowering plants, or even left-behind food will do in a pinch. They then return, perching on your hair or shoulders and whispering their secrets into your ears. This has three effects.</p>
  <li>You heal 2d4 Hit Points every 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>The first time during the duration when someone successfully Treats your Wounds, you regain an additional 4d4 Hit Points.</li>
  <li>You gain an imprecise sense out to 30 feet that senses only freshly spilled blood and rotten flesh.</li>

  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The amount of Hit Points healed every 10 minutes increases by 1d4 and the amount of Hit Points regained from the first Treat Wounds increases by 2d4.</p>
