  <hr/>
  <p>Your mind creates a violent axis of motion in a nearby space. You deal your choice of 1d6 bludgeoning or 1d6 slashing damage to all creatures in the area, with a basic Fortitude save. A creature large enough to be in more than one of the bursts takes damage only once.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> The damage increases by 1d6.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Amp</strong> Your thoughts expand in scope and power. The bursts deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage and 1d6 slashing damage, instead of the usual damage. A creature that critically fails its save is also stunned 1.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Amp Heightened (+2)</strong> Both types of damage increase by 1d6 instead of just one. Add a third non-overlapping 5-foot burst to the area.</p>
