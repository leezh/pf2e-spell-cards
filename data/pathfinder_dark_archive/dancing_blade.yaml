  <p class="hanging-indent cast"><strong>Cast</strong> somatic, verbal</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> 30 feet; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 creature</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent duration"><strong>Duration</strong> sustained up to 1 minute</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You telekinetically animate a weapon that's unattended or on your person. It brandishes itself at a foe of your choice as if wielded by an invisible duelist. When you first Cast the Spell, the weapon automatically flies to the target and Strikes. It moves along with its target, always remaining within reach. Each time you Sustain the Spell, the weapon either Changes Partners or Strikes. The weapon's attacks use and contribute to your multiple attack penalty.</p>
  <li><strong>Change Partners</strong> Change the weapon's target to a different creature within 30 feet. The weapon flies to its new target.</li>
  <li><strong>Strike</strong> (attack) The weapon attacks its target using your spell attack roll. On a hit, the weapon deals 3d6 damage, of a type determined by the weapon (if the weapon has the versatile trait or can otherwise deal multiple types of damage, you choose each time you attack).</li>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> The damage increases by 1d6.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Amp</strong> The weapon's attacks increase in strength, and your control is fine enough for advanced technique. The damage dice for the weapon's Strike change from d6s to d10s. When you Cast or Sustain the spell, you can choose from the following options in addition to the standard ones.</p>
  <li><strong>Guard</strong> Rather than attacking, the weapon grants a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against melee attacks to the creature it's following. The bonus lasts until the start of your next turn or until the weapon Changes Partners, whichever comes first.</li>
  <li><strong>Push</strong> (attack) The weapon attempts to Push its target, using your spell attack roll instead of an Athletics check to determine the results of the Push.</li>
