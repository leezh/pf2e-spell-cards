  <p class="hanging-indent defense"><strong>Defense</strong> basic Reflex; <strong>Duration</strong> sustained up to 1 minute</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You unleash energy from the broken connection to your patron. You are concealed from creatures beyond the edge of the emanation but can't use that concealment to Hide. Any creature that begins its turn in the emanation is affected based on your patron's tradition.</p>
  <li><strong>Arcane</strong> Raw energy and magical formulae circulate around you. A creature that begins its turn in the emanation gains weakness 1 to spell damage for 1 round.</li>
  <li><strong>Divine</strong> Divine power crashes in a cycle of life and death. A living or undead creature that begins its turn in the emanation gains 2 temporary Hit Points for 1 round. This effect has the spirit trait.</li>
  <li><strong>Occult</strong> Esoteric symbology etches the air. An allied creature that begins its turn in the emanation has lesser cover while inside the emanation, and for 1 round after it leaves.</li>
  <li><strong>Primal</strong> Plants and fungus symbolic of your patron constantly grow and wither in the emanation. A creature that begins its turn in the emanation has a –10-foot status penalty to all its Speeds for 1 round or until it Escapes. This effect has the fungus, plant, and wood traits.</li>
