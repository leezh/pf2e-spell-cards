  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> 60 feet; <strong>Targets</strong> your hunted prey</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent defense"><strong>Defense</strong> AC; <strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You launch a magical dart at your hunted prey, which marks them with a nimbus only you can detect. Make a spell attack against the target. On a hit, you deal 2d4 spirit damage and the target is marked by a glowing nimbus of energy that only you can see. For the duration of your spell, the marked target takes an additional +2 damage from all your weapon or unarmed attacks. Invisible targets marked by your <em>vindicator's mark</em> are concealed to you, rather than undetected.</p>
  <p>You can Dismiss the spell on your turn if your last action dealt damage to the target with a weapon or unarmed attack, instantly dealing an additional 2d6 spirit damage to it.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> The initial damage increases by 2d4, the additional damage you deal increases by 1, and the damage dealt when the spell is Dismissed increases by 1d6.</p>
