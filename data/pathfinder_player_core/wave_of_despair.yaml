  <hr/>
  <p>You inflict despair on creatures in the area. The effects for each creature are determined by its Will save.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>
  <p><strong>Success</strong> For 1 round, the creature can't use reactions and must attempt another save at the start of its turn; on a failure, it is slowed 1 for that turn as it sobs uncontrollably.</p>
  <p><strong>Failure</strong> As success, but the duration is 1 minute.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, and the creature is automatically slowed 1 for 1 minute.</p>
  <hr/>
