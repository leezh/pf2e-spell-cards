  <p>You transform the target into a form that more closes matches your creative vision. It's clearly the same item, but with aesthetic details you choose. The target is a beautiful and impressive piece for its new quality, but the effect is obviously magical and temporary, so its monetary value doesn't change. If you're an expert in Crafting, the item grants a +1 item bonus to attack rolls if it's a weapon or skill checks if it's a skill tool. When you Cast this Spell, any previous casting ends.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (7th)</strong> If you're a master in Crafting, the item grants a +2 item bonus.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (10th)</strong> If you're legendary in Crafting, the item grants a +3 item bonus.</p>
