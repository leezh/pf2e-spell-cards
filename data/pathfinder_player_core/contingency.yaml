  <p>You prepare a spell that will trigger later. While casting contingency, you also cast another spell of 4th rank or lower with a casting time of no more than 3 actions. This companion spell must be one that can affect you. You must make any decisions for the spell when you cast contingency, such as choosing a damage type for <em>resist energy</em>. During the casting, choose a trigger under which the spell will be cast, using the same restrictions as for the trigger of a Ready action. Once <em>contingency</em> is cast, you can cause the companion spell to come into effect as a reaction with that trigger. It affects only you, even if it would affect more creatures. If you define complicated conditions, as determined by the GM, the trigger might fail. If you cast <em>contingency</em> again, the newer casting supersedes the older.</p>
