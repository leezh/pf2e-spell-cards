  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> 30 feet; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 willing living creature</p>

  <p>Your words bless a creature with an enhanced connection to vital energy. When the target regains Hit Points from a healing vitality spell, it regains 2 additional Hit Points.</p>
  <p>The target regains additional Hit Points from <em>healer's blessing</em> only the first time it regains HP from a given healing spell, so a spell that heals the creature repeatedly over a duration would restore additional Hit Points only once, when they are first healed.</p>

  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The additional healing increases by 2 HP.</p>
