  <p class="hanging-indent trigger"><strong>Trigger</strong> You fail or critically fail a saving throw against an effect that has the morph, poison, or polymorph trait, or that would make you clumsy, doomed, enfeebled, petrified, or sickened</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>Your body's perfection keeps you just a little bit healthier than most. You get a failure if you rolled a critical failure or a success if you rolled a failure.</p>
