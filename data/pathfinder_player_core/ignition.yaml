  <p>You snap your fingers and point at a target, which begins to smolder. Make a spell attack roll against the target's AC, dealing 2d4 fire damage on a hit. If the target is within your melee reach, you can choose to make a melee spell attack with the flame instead of a ranged spell attack, which increases all the spell's damage dice to d6s.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target takes double damage and 1d4 persistent fire damage.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The target takes full damage.</p>
