  <p class="duration"><strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>Plants and fungi burst out or quickly grow, entangling creatures. All surfaces in the area are difficult terrain. Each round that a creature starts its turn in the area, it must attempt a Reflex save. On a failure, it takes a â€“10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until it leaves the area, and on a critical failure, it's also immobilized for 1 round. Creatures can attempt to Escape to remove these effects.</p>
