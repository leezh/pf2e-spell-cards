  <p>You transform into the shape of a legendary monster, assuming a Huge battle form. When you Cast this Spell, choose phoenix, cave worm, or sea serpent. While in this form, you gain the beast trait (for phoenix) or the animal trait (for cave worm or sea serpent). You can Dismiss the spell.</p>
  <p>You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>AC = 20 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.</li>
  <li>20 temporary Hit Points.</li>
  <li>Darkvision.</li>
  <li>One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can Strike with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +28, and you use the listed damage. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the enfeebled condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.</li>
  <li>Athletics modifier of +30, unless your own is higher.</li>
  </ul>
