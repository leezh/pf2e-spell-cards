  <p><strong>Success</strong> The target is stupefied 2 for 1 round.</p>
  <p><strong>Failure</strong> The target is stupefied 4 with an unlimited duration.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The target's intellect is permanently reduced below that of an animal, and it treats its Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom modifiers as â€“5.
