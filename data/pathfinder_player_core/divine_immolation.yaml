  <p>Divine flames scour creatures within the area. Creatures take 6d6 fire damage and 2d6 persistent fire damage. The divine power within the flames scorches the spirit as well; a creature takes spirit damage instead of fire damage from divine immolation if that would be more detrimental to the creature (as determined by the GM).</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>
  <p><strong>Success</strong> The creature takes half damage and no persistent damage.</p>
  <p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature takes full damage and persistent damage.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature takes double damage and double persistent damage.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by 1d6 and persistent damage increases by 1d6.</p>
