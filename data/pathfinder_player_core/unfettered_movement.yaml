  <p>You repel hindrances that would affect a creature. While under this spell's effect, the target ignores effects that would give them a circumstance penalty to Speed. When they attempt to Escape an effect that has them immobilized, grabbed, or restrained, they automatically succeed unless the effect is magical and of a higher rank than the <em>unfettered movement</em> spell.</p>
