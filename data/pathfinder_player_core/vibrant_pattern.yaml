  <p class="hanging-indent defense"><strong>Defense</strong> Will; <strong>Duration</strong> sustained up to 1 minute</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You create a pattern of lights that pulses with intensity. Creatures are dazzled while inside the pattern. In addition, a creature must attempt a Will saving throw if it's inside the pattern when you cast it, enters the pattern, ends its turn within the pattern, or uses a Seek or Interact action on the pattern. A creature currently blinded by the pattern doesn't need to attempt new saving throws.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is blinded by the pattern. If it exits the pattern, it can attempt a new save to recover from the blinded condition at the end of each of its turns, to a maximum duration of 1 minute.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature is blinded for 1 minute.</p>
