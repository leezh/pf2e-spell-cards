  <p class="duration"><strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You create a shroud of darkness that prevents light from penetrating or emanating within the area. Light does not enter the area and any non-magical light sources, such as a torch or lantern, do not emanate any light while inside the area, even if their light radius would extend beyond the darkness. This also suppresses magical light of your <em>darkness</em> spell's rank or lower. Light can't pass through, so creatures in the area can't see outside. From outside, it appears as a globe of pure darkness.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Heightened (4th)</strong> Even creatures with darkvision (but not greater darkvision) can barely see through the darkness. They treat targets seen through the darkness as concealed.</p>
