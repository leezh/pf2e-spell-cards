  <p>You can communicate telepathically with creatures within 30 feet. Once you establish a connection by communicating with a creature, the communication is two-way. You can communicate with only creatures that share a language with you.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (6th)</strong> You can communicate telepathically with creatures using shared mental imagery even if you don't share a language; <em>telepathy</em> loses the linguistic trait.</p>
