  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> 60 feet; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 creature</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent defense"><strong>Defense</strong> AC; <strong>Duration</strong> until the end of the target's next turn</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>A blazing band of fire arcs through the air, lighting your opponent and the ground they stand upon on fire. Make a spell attack roll against the target's AC. The ray deals 2d6 fire damage on a hit (or double damage on a critical hit). On any result other than a critical failure, the ground in the target's space catches fire, dealing 1d6 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn in one of the squares.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The ray's initial damage increases by 2d6, and the fire damage dealt by the burning space increases by 1d6.</p>
