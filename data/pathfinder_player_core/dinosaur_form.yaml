  <p>You channel the primal forces of nature to transform into a Large animal battle form, specifically that of a powerful and terrifying dinosaur. When you Cast this Spell, choose a listed battle form. You can decide the specific type of animal, but this has no effect on the form's Size or statistics. While in this form, you gain the animal and dinosaur traits. You can Dismiss the spell.</p>
  <p>You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:</p>
  <li>AC = 18 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.</li>
  <li>15 temporary Hit Points.</li>
  <li>Low-light vision and imprecise scent 30 feet.</li>
  <li>One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can Strike with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +16, and your damage bonus is +9. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the enfeebled condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.</li>
  <li>Athletics modifier of +18, unless your own is higher.</li>
  <p>You also gain specific abilities based on the form you choose:</p>
