  <hr/>
  <p>You call forth a tremendous wave to move the target either in a body of water or on the ground. You move the target up to 10 feet in any direction along the ground or 20 feet through a body of water. An unwilling target can attempt a Fortitude save, and it avoids being moved if it succeeds.</p>
