  <p>You envision a simple bug and transform into a Medium animal battle form. When you Cast this Spell, choose a listed battle form. You can decide the specific type of animal (such as such as a ladybug or scarab for beetle), but this has no effect on the form's Size or statistics. While in this form, you gain the animal trait. You can Dismiss this spell.</p>

  <li>Low-light vision.</li>
  <li>One or more attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can Strike with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +13, and your damage bonus is +2. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the enfeebled condition). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.</li>
