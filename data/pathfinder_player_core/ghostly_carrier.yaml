  <p>You create a Tiny, semi-corporeal figure with a form you choose. It hovers near you for the duration. When you Cast a Spell that has a range of touch, you can have the carrier move within range, deliver the spell to a creature there, and return to you. If the carrier must attempt a spell attack roll, it uses your normal bonuses. The carrier has your AC and saves, but it is destroyed by any damage.</p>
