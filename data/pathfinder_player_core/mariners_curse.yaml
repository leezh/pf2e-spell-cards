  <hr/>
  <p>You afflict the target with the curse of the roiling, unforgiving sea. The target must attempt a Will save.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
  <p><strong>Success</strong> The target becomes sickened 1. Reducing its sickened condition to 0 ends the curse.</p>
  <p><strong>Failure</strong> The target becomes sickened 1 and can't reduce its sickened condition below 1 while the curse remains. The curse can be lifted by 4th-rank <em>cleanse affliction</em> or similar magic. Whenever the target is sickened and on the water at least a mile from shore, it is also slowed 1.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the target becomes sickened 2.</p>
