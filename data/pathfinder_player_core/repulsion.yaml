  <p class="hanging-indent area"><strong>Area</strong> emanation up to 40 feet</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent defense"><strong>Defense</strong> Will; <strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You manifest an aura that prevents creatures from approaching you. When casting the spell, you can make the area any radius you choose, up to 40 feet. A creature must attempt a Will save if it's within the area when you Cast the Spell or as soon as it enters the area while the spell is in effect. Once a creature has attempted the save, it uses the same result for that casting of <em>repulsion</em>. Any restrictions on a creature's movement apply only if it voluntarily moves toward you; if you move closer to a creature, it doesn't then need to move away.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature's movement is not restricted.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The creature treats each square in the area as difficult terrain when moving closer to you.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> The creature can't move closer to you within the area.</p>
