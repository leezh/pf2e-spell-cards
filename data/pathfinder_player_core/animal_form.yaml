  <hr/>
  <p>You call upon primal energy to transform yourself into a Medium animal battle form. When you Cast this Spell, choose a listed battle form. You can decide the specific type of animal (such as lion or snow leopard for cat), but this has no effect on the form's Size or statistics. While in this form, you gain the animal trait. You can Dismiss the spell.</p>
  <p>You gain specific abilities based on the animal you choose:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>AC = 16 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.</li>
  <li>5 temporary Hit Points.</li>
  <li>Low-light vision and imprecise scent 30 feet.</li>
  <li>One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can Strike with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +9, and your damage bonus is +1. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the enfeebled condition, for example). If your unarmed attack bonus is higher, you can use it instead.</li>
  <li>Athletics modifier of +9, unless your own is higher.</li>
  </ul>
