  <p>While in a crowd of roughly similar creatures, your appearance becomes bland and nondescript. You gain a +2 status bonus to Deception and Stealth checks to go incognito among the crowd, and you ignore difficult terrain caused by the crowd. This counts as setting up a disguise for the Impersonate use of Deception and you add your level even if you're untrained.</p>
