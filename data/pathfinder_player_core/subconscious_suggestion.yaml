  <p class="range"><strong>Range</strong> 30 feet; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 creature</p>
  <p class="defense"><strong>Defense</strong> Will; <strong>Duration</strong> varies</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You implant a subconscious suggestion deep within the target's mind for them to follow when a trigger you specify occurs (as described on page 303). You suggest a course of action to the target. Your directive must be phrased in such a way as to seem like a logical course of action to the target, and it can't be self-destructive or obviously against the target's self-interest. The target must attempt a Will save.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected and knows you tried to control it.</p>
  <p><strong>Success</strong> The target is unaffected and thinks you were talking to them normally, not casting a spell on them.</p>
  <p><strong>Failure</strong> The suggestion remains in the target's subconscious until the next time you prepare. If the trigger occurs before then, the target immediately follows your suggestion. The effect has a duration of 1 minute, or until the target has completed a finite suggestion or the suggestion becomes self-destructive or has other obvious negative effects.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the duration is 1 hour.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Heightened (9th)</strong> You can target up to 10 creatures.</p>
