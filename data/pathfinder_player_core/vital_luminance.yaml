  <p>Drawing life force into yourself, you become a beacon of vitality. You glow with bright light in a 30-foot emanation (and dim light to the next 30 feet), and you gain an internal pool of light called a luminance reservoir, which begins with a value of 4. At the start of each of your turns, increase your reservoir by 4.</p>
  <p>If an undead creature damages you with an attack or spell while it's within the bright light of your aura, that creature takes vitality damage equal to half your luminance reservoir value. It takes this damage only the first time it damages you in a round.</p>
  <p>You can Dismiss this Spell. When you do, you can target a creature within your light and direct the vitality energy into it. The target must be a willing living creature or an undead creature. This heals a living target or deals vitality damage to an undead target equal to your luminance reservoir's value. If you Cast this Spell again, any previous casting ends.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> Both the initial value of your luminance reservoir and the amount it increases each turn increase by 1.</p>
