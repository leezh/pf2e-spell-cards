  <hr/>
  <p>With a ripple of earth, you raise small barriers from the ground. The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. The spell's area is a 5-foot burst if you spent 1 action to cast it, a 10-foot burst if you spent 2 actions, or a 15-foot burst if you spent 3 actions. A creature can Interact to clear the barriers from one 5-foot square adjacent to it.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Heightened (4th)</strong> You pull the barriers to float in the air, causing the spell to function as difficult terrain for flying creatures.</p>
