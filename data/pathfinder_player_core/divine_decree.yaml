  <hr/>
  <p>You utter a potent litany from your faith, a mandate that harms those who oppose your ideals. You deal 7d10 spirit damage to your enemies in the area; each enemy must attempt a Fortitude save.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>
  <p><strong>Success</strong> The creature takes half damage.</p>
  <p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature takes full damage and is enfeebled 2 for 1 minute.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature takes double damage and is enfeebled 2 for 1 minute. If you're on your home plane and the creature is not, the creature is sent back to its home plane. A creature of 10th level or lower must also succeed at a Will save or be paralyzed for 1 minute; if it critically fails, it dies (this is a death effect).</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by 1d10, and the level of creatures that must attempt a second save on a critical failure increases by 2.</p>
