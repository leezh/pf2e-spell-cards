  <hr/>
  <p>You cause any spells cast on the target to spill out their energy in harmful surges. The target must attempt a Will save.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
  <p><strong>Success</strong> Whenever the target becomes affected by a spell with a duration, the target takes 2d12 persistent force damage. Each time it takes persistent force damage from <em>spellwrack</em>, it reduces the remaining duration of spells affecting it by 1 round. Only a successful Arcana check against your spell DC can help the target recover from the persistent damage; the curse and the persistent damage end after 1 minute.</p>
  <p><strong>Failure</strong> As success, but the curse and persistent damage do not end on their own.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the persistent force damage is 4d12.</p>
