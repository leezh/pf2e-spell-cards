  <p class="hanging-indent cast"><strong>Cast</strong> <em>Nethys Note: No cast time was printed</em></p>
  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> 30 feet; <strong>Area</strong> 20-foot burst</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent defense"><strong>Defense</strong> Will; <strong>Duration</strong> 10 minutes</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You designate an area in which lies are revealed. Creatures in the area also take a –2 status penalty to Deception checks. Each time a creature in the area speaks a true statement, the soft ring of a bell sounds in the area. Creatures are aware of the magic; therefore, they can avoid answering questions to which they would normally respond with a lie, or they can be evasive as long as they remain within the boundaries of the truth. If a creature is in the area when the spell is cast or later enters the area, that creature attempts a Will save. It uses the results of this initial save if it leaves and reenters the area.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is so convincing that the bell rings even if they lie.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> If the target lies and succeeds at their Deception check against all targets, the bell still rings.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> The bell accurately sees through their deception and will never ring if they lie.</p>
