  <p class="hanging-indent traditions"><strong>Traditions</strong> arcane, divine, occult</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent cast"><strong>Cast</strong> 10 minutes</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> unlimited; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 creature or object</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You learn the name of the target's exact location (including the building, community, and country) and plane of existence. You can target a creature only if you've seen it in person, have one of its significant belongings, or have a piece of its body, such as a lock of hair. To target an object, you must have touched it or have a fragment of it. <em>Pinpoint</em> automatically overcomes protections against detection effects of lower rank than this spell, even if they would normally have a chance to block it.</p>
