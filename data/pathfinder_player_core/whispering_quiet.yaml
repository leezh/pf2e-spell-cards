  <p>You suppress sound in an area, preventing anyone from giving away valuable secrets. This doesn't prevent those in the area from talking or Casting a Spell, but no creature more than 5 feet away can hear its voice without succeeding at a Perception check against your spell DC, which might interfere with auditory or linguistic effects as well as communication. Other sounds created in the area are muffled to a similar volume unless that sound is created by an effect with the sonic trait.</p>
