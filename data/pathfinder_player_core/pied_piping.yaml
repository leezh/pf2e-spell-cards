  <p>Your performance enraptures listeners, compelling them to follow you. Each creature within the emanation must attempt a Will save when you Cast the Spell or the first time they enter the area, after which they become temporarily immune for 1 day. Once per turn, you can Sustain the composition to increase the emanation's radius by 5 feet. You can Dismiss the spell.</p>

  <p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is fascinated with you.</p>
