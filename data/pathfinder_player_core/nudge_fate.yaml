  <p>The barest spin of your patron's spool is enough to alter fate. When the target fails an attack roll, skill check, or saving throw and a +1 status bonus would turn a critical failure into a failure, or failure into a success, you grant the target a +1 status bonus to the check retroactively, changing the outcome appropriately. The spell then ends.</p>
  <p>If you cast <em>nudge fate</em> while a previous casting of this hex is still in effect, the previous effect ends.</p>
