  <p class="domain"><strong>Domain</strong> fate</p>
  <p class="trigger"><strong>Trigger</strong> You or an ally within range attempts a saving throw</p>
  <p class="range"><strong>Range</strong> 120 feet; <strong>Targets</strong> the triggering creature</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You twist the forces of fate to make a moment dire or uneventful, with no in-between. The target gains a +1 status bonus to the triggering saving throw. If the saving throw's result is a success, it becomes a critical success. If it's a failure, it becomes a critical failure, and the critical failure can't be reduced by abilities that usually reduce critical failure.</p>
  <p>If the triggering ability did not have both a critical success and critical failure condition, tempt fate fails, but you don't expend the Focus Point for Casting this Spell.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Heightened (8th)</strong> The bonus on the saving throw is +2.</p>
