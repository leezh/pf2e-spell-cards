  <p>The primal power of the world flows through you. You transform into an incarnation of nature, either a green man or a kaiju. Your battle form is Medium for a green man or Gargantuan (30-foot-by-30-foot space) for a kaiju. While in this form, you gain the plant trait (for a green man) or the beast trait (for a kaiju). You can Dismiss the spell.</p>
  <p>You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>AC = 25 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.</li>
  <li>30 temporary Hit Points.</li>
  <li>Darkvision.</li>
  <li>One or more attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can Strike with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +34, and you use the listed damage. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the enfeebled condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.</li>
  <li>Athletics modifier of +36, unless your own is higher.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You gain specific abilities based on the incarnation you choose:</p>
