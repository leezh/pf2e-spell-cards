  <p>You afflict the target with a curse that makes its presence abrasive and off-putting. The target must attempt a Will save.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
  <p><strong>Success</strong> For 10 minutes, the target must roll twice and use the worse result whenever attempting a Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, or Performance check, and creatures they encounter have an initial attitude toward them of one step worse (for instance, unfriendly instead of indifferent).</p>
  <p><strong>Failure</strong> As success, but the effect is permanent.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, and creatures that the target encounters have an initial attitude toward them of two steps worse.</p>
