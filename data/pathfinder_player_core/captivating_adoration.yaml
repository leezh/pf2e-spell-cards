  <p>You become intensely entrancing, and creatures are distracted by you as long as they remain within the area. You can exclude any creatures you choose from the effects. If a creature is in the aura when you Cast the Spell or when it enters the aura for the first time, it must attempt a Will saving throw. If a creature leaves and reenters, it uses the results of its original save.</p>
