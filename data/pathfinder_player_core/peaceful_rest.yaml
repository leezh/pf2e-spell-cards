  <p class="range"><strong>Range</strong> touch; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 corpse</p>
  <p class="duration"><strong>Duration</strong> until your next daily preparations</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>The targeted corpse doesn't decay, nor can it be transformed into an undead. If the corpse is subject to a spell that requires the corpse to have died within a certain amount of time (for example, <em>raise dead</em>), do not count the duration of <em>peaceful rest</em> against that time. This spell also prevents ordinary bugs and pests (such as maggots) from consuming the body.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Heightened (5th)</strong> The spell's duration is unlimited, but the spell takes one more action to cast and requires a cost (embalming fluid worth 6 gp).</p>
