  <p class="traditions"><strong>Traditions</strong> arcane, occult</p>
  <p class="cast"><strong>Cast</strong> 1 minute</p>
  <p class="range"><strong>Range</strong> 30 feet; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 creature</p>
  <p class="defense"><strong>Defense</strong> Will; <strong>Duration</strong> sustained up to 1 minute</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You cast your thoughts through a creature's mind, sifting for information. You access the target's memories and knowledge unless it fends you off with a Will save.</p>
  <p><strong>Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
  <p><strong>Failure</strong> Each round of the spell's duration, you can Sustain the spell to ask a different question and attempt to uncover the answer. For each question, the target can attempt a Deception check against your spell DC; if the target succeeds, you don't learn the answer, and on a critical success, the target gives you a false answer that you believe is truthful. Once you've asked the target a given question, asking it again, even with a separate casting of <em>mind probe</em>, produces the same result.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, and the target takes a â€“4 circumstance penalty to Deception checks against your questions</p>
