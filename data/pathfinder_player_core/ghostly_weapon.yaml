  <p>The target weapon becomes translucent and ghostly, and it can affect material and incorporeal creatures and objects. It gains the effects of the <em>ghost touch</em> property rune, meaning it is magical if it wasn't already, is especially effective against incorporeal creatures, and can be wielded by a corporeal or incorporeal creature.</p>
