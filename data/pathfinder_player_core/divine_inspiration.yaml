  <p>You infuse a target with spiritual energy, refreshing its magic. If it prepares spells, it recovers one 6th-rank or lower spell it previously cast today and can cast that spell again. If it spontaneously casts spells, it recovers one of its 6th-rank or lower spell slots. If it has a focus pool, it regains its Focus Points, as if it had Refocused.</p>
