  <p>Your performance makes allies feel they can succeed at anything. This counts as having prepared to Aid your ally on a skill check of your choice. When you later use the Aid reaction, you can roll Performance instead of the normal skill check, and if you roll a failure, you get a success instead. If you are legendary in Performance, you automatically critically succeed. The GM might rule that you can't use this ability if the act of encouraging your ally would interfere with the skill check (such as a check to Sneak quietly or maintain a disguise).</p>
