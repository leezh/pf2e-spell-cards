  <p class="range"><strong>Range</strong> 120 feet; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 creature</p>
  <p class="defense"><strong>Defense</strong> Will</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You scramble a creature's mental faculties and sensory input. The target must attempt a Will saving throw. Regardless of the result of that save, the target is then temporarily immune for 10 minutes. <em>Warp mind's</em> effects happen instantly, so <em>dispel magic</em> and other effects that counteract spells can't counteract them. However, <em>wish</em> rituals and abilities that can remove non-magical effects can still counteract the effects.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
  <p><strong>Success</strong> The target spends the first action on its next turn with the confused condition.</p>
  <p><strong>Failure</strong> The target is confused for 1 minute.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The target is confused permanently.</p>
