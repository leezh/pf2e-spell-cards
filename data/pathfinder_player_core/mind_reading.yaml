  <p>With a cursory mental touch, you attempt to read the target's mind. It must attempt a Will save. The target then becomes temporarily immune to your <em>mind reading</em> for 1 hour.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target perceives vague surface thoughts from you when you Cast the Spell.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> You find out whether the target's Intelligence modifier is higher than, equal to, or lower than yours.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> You perceive vague surface thoughts from the target when you Cast the Spell, and you find out whether its Intelligence is higher than, equal to, or lower than yours.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, and for the duration of the spell, you can Sustain the spell to detect the target's surface thoughts again. The target doesn't receive any additional saves.</p>
