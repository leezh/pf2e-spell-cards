  <p class="trigger"><strong>Trigger</strong> A creatureâ€™s dying condition would reach the value at which they would die</p>
  <p class="range"><strong>Range</strong> 60 feet; <strong>Targets</strong> the triggering creature</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>Your ode staves off death. The target's dying condition remains 1 below the value at which it dies. This doesn't help prevent death from effects that kill the target without increasing its dying condition, such as <em>disintegrate</em> and death effects.</p>
