  <p>You erect protective wards that make the target difficult to detect via magic. <em>Veil of privacy</em> attempts to counteract all detection, revelation, and scrying effects used against the target or the target's gear throughout the duration, counting cantrips as 1st-rank spells for this purpose. Successfully counteracting a spell that targets an area or multiple targets negates the effects for only <em>veil of privacy's</em> target.</p>
