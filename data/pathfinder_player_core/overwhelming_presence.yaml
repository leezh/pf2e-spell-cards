  <p class="area"><strong>Area</strong> 40-foot burst</p>
  <p class="targets"><strong>Targets</strong> any number of creatures</p>
  <p class="defense"><strong>Defense</strong> Will; <strong>Duration</strong> until full tribute is paid</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You surround yourself with supernatural splendor, appearing to be a god or similarly majestic being, with an appearance, regalia, and iconography of your choice. Targets must attempt a Will save. Regardless of the outcome, the target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
  <p><strong>Success</strong> The target must pay tribute to you two times. Paying tribute requires that the target spend a single action, which has either the move trait (as they bow) or manipulate trait (as they offer up a token in their hands). They must pay tribute at least once on each of their turns, if possible. While affected, the target is fascinated by you and can't use hostile actions against you.</p>
  <p><strong>Failure</strong> As success, but the target must pay tribute a total of six times.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the target must spend all its actions paying tribute, and they cannot take other actions until the tribute is fully paid.</p>
