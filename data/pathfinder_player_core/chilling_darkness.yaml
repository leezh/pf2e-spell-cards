  <p class="defense"><strong>Defense</strong> AC</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You shoot an utterly cold ray of darkness tinged with unholy energy. Make a ranged spell attack. The ray deals 5d6 cold damage. If the target has the holy trait, you deal an extra 5d6 spirit damage.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target takes double damage.</p>
  <p><strong>Success</strong> The target takes full damage.</p>
  <p>If the ray passes through an area of magical light or targets a creature affected by magical light, <em>chilling darkness</em> attempts to counteract the light. If you need to determine whether the ray passes through an area of light, draw a line between yourself and the spell's target.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The cold damage increases by 2d6, and the spirit damage against holy creatures increases by 2d6.</p>
