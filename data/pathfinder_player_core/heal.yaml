  <hr/>
  <p>You channel vital energy to heal the living or damage the undead. If the target is a willing living creature, you restore 1d8 Hit Points. If the target is undead, you deal that amount of vitality damage to it, and it gets a basic Fortitude save. The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell determines its targets, range, area, and other parameters.</p>
  <p>[one-action] The spell has a range of touch.</p>
  <p>[two-actions] (concentrate) The spell has a range of 30 feet. If you're healing a living creature, increase the Hit Points restored by 8.</p>
  <p>[three-actions] (concentrate) You disperse vital energy in a 30-foot emanation. This targets all living and undead creatures in the burst.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The amount of healing or damage increases by 1d8, and the extra healing for the 2-action version increases by 8.</p>
