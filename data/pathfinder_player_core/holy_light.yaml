  <p>You shine a blazing ray of light tinged with holy energy. Make a ranged spell attack. The ray deals 5d6 fire damage. If the target has the unholy trait, you deal an extra 5d6 spirit damage.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target takes double damage.</p>
  <p><strong>Success</strong> The target takes full damage.</p>
  <p>If the light passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, <em>holy light</em> attempts to counteract the darkness. If you need to determine whether the light passes through an area of darkness, draw a line between yourself and the spell's target.</p>
