  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> 120 feet; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 creature, unattended object, or force construct</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent defense"><strong>Defense</strong> AC and basic Fortitude</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>A black tracer bolt flies toward your target, and upon making contact intensifies into a powerful destructive beam. Make a spell attack against the target. If you hit an object or force construct (such as a <em>wall of force</em>), it's destroyed with no save unless it's an artifact or similarly powerful. A single casting can destroy no more than a 10-foot cube of matter.</p>
  <p>If you hit a creature, it takes 12d10 damage (no damage type) with a basic Fortitude save. If you critically hit, the target gets a result one degree of success worse than the outcome of its Fortitude save. A creature reduced to 0 HP is blasted to fine powder; its gear remains.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by 2d10.</p>
