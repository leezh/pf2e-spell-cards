  <p class="range"><strong>Range</strong> 120 feet; <strong>Area</strong> 5-foot radius, 80-foot-tall cylinder</p>
  <p class="defense"><strong>Defense</strong> Reflex</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>The ground opens up, spraying a column of lava high into the air in a vertical cylinder, dealing 14d6 fire damage to creatures in the area. The lava rapidly cools and encases creatures in the area. A creature encased in rock is clumsy 1 and takes a â€“10-foot status penalty to its Speeds. All normal terrain is difficult terrain to a flying creature, and such creatures immediately descend 20 feet the moment they're encased, but they don't take damage from this fall. A creature encased in rock can attempt to Escape against your spell DC to end the effect. Otherwise, the creature remains encased until it takes a total of 50 damage, freeing it from the rock.</p>
  <p>Additionally, creatures in the area and those within 5 feet of the lava column automatically take 3d6 fire damage from the intense heat, regardless of the results of their saving throws.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>
  <p><strong>Success</strong> The creature takes half damage.</p>
  <p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature takes full damage and is encased.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature takes double damage and is encased.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage in the area increases by 2d6, and the damage from the intense heat increases by 1d6.</p>
