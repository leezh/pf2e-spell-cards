  <p>With the threat of more pain, you compel a creature you've recently harmed. You issue a command to the target, with the effects of the spell <em>command</em>. If the target is frightened, stupefied, or taking persistent damage, it takes a –2 circumstance penalty to the save. Regardless of the result, the target is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.</p>
