  <p class="hanging-indent requirements"><strong>Requirements</strong> Your most recent action dealt damage to a target</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> 100 feet; <strong>Targets</strong> a creature you dealt damage to on your most recent action</p>

  <hr/>
  <p>With the threat of more pain, you compel a creature you've recently harmed. You issue a command to the target, with the effects of the spell command. If the target is frightened, stupefied, or taking persistent damage, it takes a –2 circumstance penalty to the save. Regardless of the result, the target is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.</p>
