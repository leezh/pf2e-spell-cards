  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> 120 feet; <strong>Area</strong> 10-foot burst</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent defense"><strong>Defense</strong> Will; <strong>Duration</strong> sustained up to 1 minute</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You create a cloud of mesmerizing patterns and colors that hovers in the air. Creatures are dazzled while inside the cloud. In addition, a creature must attempt a Will saving throw if it is inside the cloud when you cast it, when it enters the cloud, when it ends its turn within the cloud, or if it uses a Seek or Interact action on the cloud. A creature currently fascinated by <em>hypnotize</em> doesn't attempt new saves.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> The target is fascinated by the cloud.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The target is fascinated by the cloud. While it remains fascinated, it can't use reactions.</p>
