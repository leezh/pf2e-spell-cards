  <p class="hanging-indent cast"><strong>Cast</strong> 10 minutes</p>

  <hr/>
  <p>An opaque shell of drifting, iridescent runes covers the area, creating a bubble. You can choose to make the burst smaller, in 10-foot increments. The runes don't block travel, but those inside the bubble can't perceive those outside it and vice versa. Detection and scrying effects are likewise blocked.</p>
  <p>Creatures sleeping within the bubble are immune to dreams sent by spells. Those sleeping 8 hours reduce their doomed condition by 2 instead of 1.</p>
