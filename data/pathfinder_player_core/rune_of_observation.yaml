  <p class="hanging-indent duration"><strong>Duration</strong> 1 hour</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You inscribe an invisible eye-shaped rune in the air, creating a sensor as <em>clairvoyance</em>. When created, this eye must be in your line of sight.</p>
  <p>Each time the spell's duration ends, you can spend 1 Focus Point as a free action to extend the duration for another hour, though as normal, it ends immediately during your next daily preparations.</p>
