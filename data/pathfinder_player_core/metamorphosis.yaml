  <p>Harnessing your mastery of transformative magic, you hide forms within forms. You transform yourself into any form you could choose with a polymorph spell in your spell repertoire or that you could prepare of 8th-rank or lower (including any 8th-rank or lower heightened versions of spells you know). You gain 40 temporary Hit Points rather than the amount normally granted by the form.</p>
  <p>You can Sustain the spell to enter a new form you haven't used during this <em>metamorphosis</em>. This replenishes your temporary Hit Points from this spell.</p>
