  <p>You tilt the scales of luck slightly to protect a creature from disaster. When the target would attempt a saving throw, it can roll twice and use the better result. Once it does this, the spell ends. If you cast <em>bit of luck</em> again, any previous bit of luck you cast that's still in effect ends. After a creature has been targeted with <em>bit of luck</em>, it becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours.</p>
