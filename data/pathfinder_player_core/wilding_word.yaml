  <hr/>
  <p>Your patron's majesty—or their displeasure—comes in a growl from your throat, making other creatures reluctant to harm you. The target must attempt a Will save; if the creature is an animal, fungus, or plant, it takes a –1 circumstance penalty to its save.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
  <p><strong>Success</strong> When the target attempts an attack roll or skill check that would harm you, it takes a –2 status penalty to its roll.</p>
  <p><strong>Failure</strong> As success, but the target also becomes sickened 1 each time it damages you.</p>
  <p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the sickened value is 2.</p>
