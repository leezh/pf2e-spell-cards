  <p>Your symphony lifts listeners from their worldly concerns. Attempt a Performance check to counteract an effect applying one of the following conditions to the target: grabbed, immobilized, paralyzed, restrained, slowed, or stunned. If you fail, you can't target the same effect on the target for 1 day. Use the condition's source to determine the counteract DC (for example, the Escape DC for grabbed).</p>
