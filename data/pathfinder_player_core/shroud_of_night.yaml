  <p class="patron"><strong>Patron</strong> Starless Shadow</p>
  <p class="range"><strong>Range</strong> 30 feet; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 creature</p>
  <p class="defense"><strong>Defense</strong> Will; <strong>Duration</strong> sustained up to 1 minute</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>Your patron blankets the target's eyes in darkness. If you cast this hex on a willing ally (for instance, one with light blindness), the ally can choose which result it gets without rolling.</p>
  <p><strong>Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
  <p><strong>Failure</strong> The target is shrouded in murky darkness. It treats bright light as dim light, and unless it has greater darkvision, all creatures are concealed to it.</p>
