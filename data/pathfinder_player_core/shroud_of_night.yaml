  <hr/>
  <p>Your patron blankets the target's eyes in darkness. If you cast this hex on a willing ally (for instance, one with light blindness), the ally can choose which result it gets without rolling.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> The target is shrouded in murky darkness. It treats bright light as dim light, and unless it has greater darkvision, all creatures are concealed to it.</p>
