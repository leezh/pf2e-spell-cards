  <p>With soothing words, you lull the target into an enchanting dream. When you Cast the Spell, the target falls unconscious if it wasn't already. While unconscious, it experiences a dream of your choice, though lucidly enough it can wake when it pleases. If it wakes up before 1 minute of sleep has passed, the spell ends.</p>
  <p>If you Cast this Spell again, any previous sweet dream you cast ends.</p>
