  <p>When you touch the target, a symbol of the moon appears on its forehead, glowing with soft moonlight. The target glows with dim light in a 20-foot radius. It also gets a benefit based on a phase of the moon, starting with the new moon and changing to the next phase at the end of each of its turns.</p>

  <li><strong>New Moon</strong> The target receives no benefit.</li>
  <li><strong>Waxing Moon</strong> The target gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and a +4 status bonus to damage rolls.</li>
