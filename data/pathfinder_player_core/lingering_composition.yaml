  <p>You add a flourish to your composition to extend its benefits. If your next action is to cast a cantrip composition with a duration of 1 round, attempt a Performance check. The DC is usually a standard-difficulty DC of a level equal to the highest-level target of your composition, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances. The effect depends on the result of your check.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Success</strong> The composition lasts 4 rounds.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The composition lasts 3 rounds.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> The composition lasts 1 round, but you don't spend the Focus Point for casting this spell.</p>
