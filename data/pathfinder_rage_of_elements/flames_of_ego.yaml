  <p class="hanging-indent traditions"><strong>Traditions</strong> arcane, occult, primal</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> 120 feet; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 creature</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent defense"><strong>Defense</strong> Will; <strong>Duration</strong> varies</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>Elegant flames of incredible beauty coruscate across the target's body, creating overconfidence and carelessness. The target attempts a Will save.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The target sheds bright light in a 20-foot emanation (and dim light to the next 40 feet) and becomes fascinated with itself for 1 round. It must spend at least 1 action on its turn on a taunting display of arrogance or overconfidence. Using actions that include such a display—such as using Perform to show off—count toward this requirement.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> As success, but the duration is 1 minute and the target can't act hostile toward a creature until that creature acts hostile toward the target.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, except the target must spend at least 2 actions on its turn on a taunting display of arrogance or overconfidence.</p>
