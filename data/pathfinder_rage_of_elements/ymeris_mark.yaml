  <hr/>
  <p>You place the fiery mark of the Queen of the Inferno on the target, burning into the creature's very essence. The mark gives off a heat that only you can sense; as long as you're on the same plane as the target, you can sense the direction it's in. The target is fatigued and can't reduce the value of this condition normally.</p>
  <p>You can detonate the mark at any point during its duration by Dismissing the spell. The rune explodes in a 10-foot emanation centered on the target that deals 5d6 fire damage with a basic Reflex save. You choose whether the mark's target is included in the explosion.</p>
  <p>When you cast the spell, the target attempts a Fortitude save to determine how long the mark lasts. If the spell's duration elapses, the rune doesn't detonate.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The duration is 1 minute.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> The duration is 1 week.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The duration is unlimited.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by 2d6.</p>
