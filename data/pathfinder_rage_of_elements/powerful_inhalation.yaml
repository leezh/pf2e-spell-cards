  <hr/>
  <p>You rapidly draw the air from your surroundings, hoarding it for yourself. Creatures in the area when the spell is cast take 5d6 bludgeoning damage with a basic Fortitude save. A creature that fails its save can't speak above a raspy whisper for 1 round. A creature that critically fails can't speak or use abilities that require it to breathe for 1 round. This prevents it from using effects that require speech and from using a breath weapon or similar ability.</p>
  <p>Creatures made of air (such as air elementals) attempting a save against this spell get a degree of success one worse than they rolled.</p>
