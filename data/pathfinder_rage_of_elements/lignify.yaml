  <p class="hanging-indent traditions"><strong>Traditions</strong> arcane, primal</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> 120 feet; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 creature made of flesh</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent defense"><strong>Defense</strong> Fortitude; <strong>Duration</strong> varies</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You turn the target's flesh slowly into wood. The target must attempt a Fortitude save. Creatures with the plant trait have a +2 circumstance bonus to saves against this spell.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The target is slowed 1 for 1 round.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> The target is slowed 1 and must attempt a Fortitude save at the end of each of its turns; this ongoing save has the incapacitation trait. On a failed save, the slowed condition increases by 1 (or 2 on a critical failure). A successful save reduces the slowed condition by 1. When a creature is unable to act due to the slowed condition from <em>lignify</em>, the creature is permanently non-magically petrified, though it's turned to wood instead of stone. The spell ends if the creature is magically petrified or the slowed condition is removed.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the target is initially slowed 2.</p>
