  <p>You cause a splash of cold water to descend on an ally's head, granting some temporary vigor. The target gains 1d4 temporary Hit Points, which last for 1 minute. The target is then temporarily immune to the temporary Hit Points from <em>rousing splash</em> for 10 minutes. The target can also attempt an immediate flat check to recover from a single source of persistent acid or fire damage, with the DC reduction from appropriate assistance.</p>
