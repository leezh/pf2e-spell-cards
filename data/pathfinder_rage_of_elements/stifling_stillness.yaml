  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> 120 feet; <strong>Area</strong> 20-foot burst</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent defense"><strong>Defense</strong> basic Fortitude; <strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You make all air in the target area unnaturally still and unyielding, creating a shimmering haze. The stagnant, heavy air becomes an area of difficult terrain. Creatures in the area that breathe air and aren't holding their breath must spend a single action on their turn straining to breathe the stagnant air; once they do, they still mostly breathe their own exhaled air, taking 3d6 poison damage (basic Fortitude save) and becoming fatigued.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> The damage increases by 3d6.</p>
