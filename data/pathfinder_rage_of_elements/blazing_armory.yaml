  <p>As long as you have magic, you're never unarmed. You materialize a flaming simulacrum of any common simple or martial weapon into the target's grasp. The target must have a free hand to hold the weapon, or else the weapon falls to the ground in the target's space. The blazing weapon functions as a <em>+1 striking</em> weapon, and its damage type changes to fire. The damage type can't be changed using the versatile trait, modular trait, or similar methods.</p>
  <p>A thrown weapon rematerializes in the target's hand after the Strike is complete. If you choose a ranged weapon that uses ammunition, the wielder must still reload the weapon using the normal number of actions, though this generates ammunition automatically; this functions as normal ammunition, and the <em>blazing weapon</em> can't use other types of ammunition.</p>
  <p>Any creature other than you or the target that attempts to touch, make a Strike with, or Disarm the weapon takes 1d6 fire damage each time.</p>
