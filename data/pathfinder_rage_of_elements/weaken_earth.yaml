  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> touch; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 creature, unattended object, or hazard or structure made of stone or earth</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent defense"><strong>Defense</strong> Fortitude; <strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You weaken the bonds that hold earth and stone together. If your target has Hardness, you can affect one contiguous object, up to a 5-foot cube, or one creature, decreasing the Hardness by 5, to a minimum of 0. If the target lacks Hardness, it gains weakness 3 to physical damage. A target with a Fortitude modifier can attempt a Fortitude saving throw, negating the effect on a success.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> Hardness decreases by 5, the size of a contiguous object increases by one 5-foot cube, and the weakness increases by 3.</p>
