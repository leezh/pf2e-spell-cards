  <p>You cultivate four wooden bulbs, each filled with toxic pollen and sensitive to motion. When a creature enters a space adjacent to a bulb, or when a bulb is touched or damaged (each bulb has AC 5), the bulb blossoms and releases pollen in a 15-foot emanation. Creatures in the area take 8d8 poison damage and must attempt a Fortitude save with the following results.</p>
