  <p class="hanging-indent traditions"><strong>Traditions</strong> arcane, primal</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent trigger"><strong>Trigger</strong> You or an ally in range is targeted by a ranged attack.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> 60 feet; <strong>Targets</strong> the creature targeted by the attack</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent duration"><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>A cloud of mist enshrouds the target, appearing much like the deflecting clouds created by cloud dragons. The target is treated as hidden for the purposes of resolving the triggering attack (so normally the attacker must succeed at a DC 11 flat check to target it) and all ranged attacks against it for the duration.</p>
