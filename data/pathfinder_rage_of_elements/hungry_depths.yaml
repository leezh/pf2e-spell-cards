  <hr/>
  <p>A spiral of dark, corrupted water appears in the ground, plunging open a door to the depths that seems to descend for miles. Disembodied glowing eyes and gnashing teeth spin within the vortex, consuming anything that crosses their path.</p>
  <p>All creatures in the area take 4d8 piercing damage plus 4d4 void damage (basic Reflex save). Each time you Sustain the spell, you can increase the vortex's radius by 5 feet, to a maximum of 15 feet, or you can move the vortex up to 10 feet in a straight line. Each creature the vortex moves through takes the damage with a basic Reflex save.A creature can take damage from <em>hungry depths</em> only once per round.</p>
  <p>If cast underwater, <em>hungry depths</em> instead fills a 40-foot-tall cylinder with a 5-foot radius.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (9th)</strong> The vortex deals 5d8 piercing damage and 5d4 void damage.</p>
