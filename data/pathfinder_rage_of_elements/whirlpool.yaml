  <p>With a spin of your hand, you create a large swirling vortex of storming waves. All squares in the <em>whirlpool</em> are difficult terrain. The constant churning of the fierce waves means that creatures are constantly tossed between areas of air and water, allowing both air- and water-breathing creatures to breathe within the vortex. Any creature with a swim Speed can Swim instead of Stride to move within the <em>whirlpool</em>; the DC to Swim within it is equal to your spell DC.</p>
  <p>All creatures in the area take 6d10 bludgeoning damage as the waves crash into them. On subsequent rounds, the first time you Sustain the spell each round, the waves crash again with the same effect.</p>
