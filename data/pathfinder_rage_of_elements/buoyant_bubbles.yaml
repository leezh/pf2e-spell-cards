  <p>You create a thin layer of foamy bubbles that adhere to the target, causing it to float in water and similar liquids. The target doesn't sink, even if it hasn't succeeded at a Swim check this round; an already-sinking target resurfaces with the bubbles' help over the course of 1 round. If on a plane where the water or liquid has a surface, the bubbles also prevent the target from diving beneath that surface unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save against your spell DC.</p>
