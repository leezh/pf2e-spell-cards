  <p class="hanging-indent traditions"><strong>Traditions</strong> arcane, primal</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> 120 feet; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 creature or object on the ground</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent defense"><strong>Defense</strong> Reflex</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You strike the ground, and unleash a wave that travels through the struck surface to the target. The effect ends as soon as it can't travel through a solid surface, such as a stone floor. Each creature in a line between you and the target is shaken by tremors and must attempt a Reflex saving throw against your spell DC. A creature that fails this save is pushed 10 feet away from you.</p>
  <p>The wave explodes once it reaches the target, showering the target with earth and stone and dealing 12d10 bludgeoning damage with a basic Reflex save. A target that fails its save against this explosion is also pushed back 10 feet and knocked prone. A creature subject to the explosion doesn't need to save against the tremors.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (9th)</strong> The wave explodes on one additional target of your choice in the line to the final target.</p>
