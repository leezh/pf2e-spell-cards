  <p class="hanging-indent requirements"><strong>Requirements</strong> You're wielding a staff.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You spin your staff with a twirling flourish, attacking two foes and transforming the momentum into magical energy to charge for your next Spellstrike. Make a melee Strike with your staff against one foe and then a second melee Strike with your staff against a different foe. Your multiple attack penalty applies to both of these attacks as normal.</p>
