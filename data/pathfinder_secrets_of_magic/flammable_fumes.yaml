  <p>Sending magic deep underground, you conjure a cloud of toxic gases that swiftly degenerate into volatile fumes. The gases are invisible, requiring a successful Perception check against your spell DC to detect visually, though their acrid smell and toxic effects are clear once a creature has entered the cloud. A creature that enters the cloud or is within the cloud at the start of its turn takes 2d6 poison damage. A creature can take the poison damage from <em>flammable fumes</em> only once per round.</p>
  <p>One round after you conjure the cloud, the gases loses stability and become flammable. If an open flame is brought into the cloud, or if anyone within the area uses a fire effect, the cloud detonates in a massive blaze that deals 10d6 fire damage with a basic Reflex save to all creatures within it, and the spell ends.</p>

  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> The poison damage increases by 1d6 and the fire damage on an explosion increases by 2d6.</p>
