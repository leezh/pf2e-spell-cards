  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> varies; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 creature</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You briefly turn your attack into pure force to bypass your opponent's defenses. Choose a target within your reach, or within the reach of a melee weapon you're wielding. If you can use Spellstrike with a ranged weapon (with the starlit span hybrid study, for example), you can target a creature in the first range increment of your ranged weapon. For an instant, you transform your weapon or unarmed attack into a spike of pure force, replacing all its normal statistics and abilities. The <em>force fang</em> automatically deals 1d4+1 force damage to the target.</p>

  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> The damage increases by 1d4+1.</p>
