  <hr/>
  <p>You draw elemental power from your surroundings, and combining it with your own magical energy, unleash a wave of utter destruction and swirling colors that deals 1d6 fire damage and 3d6 bludgeoning damage with a basic Reflex save. The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell determines the area and other parameters.</p>
  <p>[two-actions] <strong>(somatic, verbal)</strong> The spell is a 30-foot cone.</p>
  <p>[three-actions] <strong>(material, somatic, verbal)</strong> The spell is a 30-foot cone. On a failed saving throw, creatures are pushed 5 feet away from you, and on a critical failure they are pushed 10 feet away and are knocked prone.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Two Rounds</strong> If you spend 3 actions Casting the Spell, you can avoid finishing the spell and spend another 3 actions on your next turn to empower the spell even further. If you do, the spell is as 3 actions, but the area is a 60-foot cone, and for 1 round, the elements linger in the cone, racing off into the distance and making approaching you difficult, with the effects of <em>gust of wind</em>.</p>

  <p>You can replace the air trait with the metal and wood traits when you cast the spell.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> The damage increases by 1d6 fire and 3d6 bludgeoning, and the distance that enemies are pushed back if you spent 3 actions or 2 rounds increases by 5 feet on a failed save and 10 feet on a critical failure.</p>
