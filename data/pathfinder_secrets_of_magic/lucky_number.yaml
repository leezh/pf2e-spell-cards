  <p>When you Cast this Spell, roll 1d20 and make a note of the result. You gain the following reaction; once you use the reaction, the spell ends, and you become temporarily immune to <em>lucky number</em> until the next time you make your daily preparations.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>That's My Number!</strong> [reaction] (divination, fortune) <strong>Trigger</strong> You roll your lucky number as your d20 result on a non-secret attack roll, saving throw, or skill check; <strong>Effect</strong> You call upon the fortune stored within your lucky number and reroll the triggering check. However, pushing your luck has a price: if your result on the reroll is the same number again, you critically fail, regardless of what degree of success you ordinarily would have received.</p>
