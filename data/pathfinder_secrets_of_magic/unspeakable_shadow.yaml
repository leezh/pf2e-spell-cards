  <p class="hanging-indent cast"><strong>Cast</strong> somatic, verbal</p>

  <p class="hanging-indent defense"><strong>Defense</strong> Will; <strong>Duration</strong> varies</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You alter a creature's shadow, transforming it into a terrifying monster out to devour the creature. The creature must attempt a Will save. A creature that has the frightened condition from <em>unspeakable shadow</em> must spend at least one of its actions each turn to either attack its shadow (making a Strike ineffectually) or flee from its shadow (using one action to move away as though it had the fleeing condition).</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The target is frightened 2.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> The target is frightened 3. It can't reduce its frightened value below 1 for 1 minute.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The target is so afraid, it might instantly die. It must succeed at a Fortitude save or die; this saving throw has the incapacitation trait. If it succeeds at its save, the target is frightened 4 and can't reduce its frightened value below 1 for 1 minute.</p>
