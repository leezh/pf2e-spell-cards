  <p>You bombard a target with distracting auditory illusions, surrounding them with a tumultuous cacophony of overlapping speech, whispers, screams, and muttering. The target is flat-footed, takes a –2 status penalty to purely auditory Perception checks, and must succeed at a DC 5 flat check to use auditory abilities or verbal spell components. Similarly, a creature who attempts to affect the target with an auditory effect must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the attempt fails. The duration depends on the target's Will save.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The duration is 1 round.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> The duration is 3 rounds.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The duration is 1 minute.</p>
