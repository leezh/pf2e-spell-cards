  <hr/>
  <p>You surround a moving creature with lifelike illusions, shifting their perception of the terrain to subtly lead them off course. The target must attempt a Will save. Regardless of the result, the creature is immune to <em>lose the path</em> for 1 hour.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> The creature treats all squares as difficult terrain for its Stride.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, except that you determine where the target moves during the Stride, though you can't move it into hazardous terrain or to a place it can't stand.</p>
