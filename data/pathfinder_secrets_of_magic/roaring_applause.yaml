  <hr/>
  <p>Your flamboyant flourish invokes such powerful feelings in your audience that you incite cheers and applause. Targets of this spell must be able to see, hear, or otherwise understand you. The targets must attempt a Will save.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The target becomes mildly distracted by your display and applauds while it isn't fully occupied. It can't use reactions.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> The target applauds you so vigorously that it can't use reactions and is slowed 1. The applause is so involved that it has the manipulate trait. This triggers reactions based on the manipulate trait at the start of the target's turn.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, plus the target is so distracted by its vigorous applauding of you that it's fascinated with you.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (6th)</strong> You can target up to 10 creatures.</p>
