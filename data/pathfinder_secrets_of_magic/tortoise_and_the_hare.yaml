  <p>You prove that slow and steady doesn't always win the race by turning a foe into a proverbial tortoise and yourself or an ally into a hare, siphoning some of the foe's speed and granting it to the other target. The effects depend on the foe's Fortitude save.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Success</strong> The targets are unaffected.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The foe is slowed 1 for 1 round, and the other target is unaffected.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> The foe is slowed 1 for 3 rounds and the other target is quickened for 1 round. It can use the extra action to Step, Stride, or Strike.</p>
