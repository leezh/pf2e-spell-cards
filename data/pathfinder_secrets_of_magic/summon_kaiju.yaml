  <p>You briefly conjure a kaiju, a massive, rampaging monster with a unique name and legendary reputation. It rises from its secluded lair to annihilate your foes. The summoned kaiju occupies the space of a Gargantuan creature. When you Cast this Spell, choose one of the kaiju below to summon.</p>
  <li><strong>Agmazar the Star Titan</strong> Speed 100 feet, climb 50 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> (necromancy, negative) <em>Channel Void</em> Each foe in a 100-foot emanation takes 16d8 negative energy damage with a basic Fortitude save; <strong>Depart</strong> (transmutation) <em>Gravitic Repulsion</em> Each foe in a 50-foot emanation is pushed 100 feet away unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save.</li>
  <li><strong>Agyra, the Forever Storm</strong> Speed 80 feet, fly 200 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> (electricity, evocation) <em>Breath of a Thousand Storms</em> Agyra shoots two 1,200-foot lines of electricity, one from each of her heads. The lines can't overlap. Each creature along one of the lines takes 6d12 electricity damage with a basic Reflex save. On a failure, the creature is also slowed 1 for 1 round (or for 1 minute on a critical failure); <strong>Depart</strong> (evocation, sonic) <em>Thunderous Blast</em> Each creature within a 100-foot emanation takes 6d10 sonic damage with a basic Reflex save, and is also knocked prone on a failed save.</li>
  <li><strong>Bezravnis, the Inferno Below</strong> Speed 100 feet, burrow 100 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> (earth, evocation) <em>Burrow from the Earth's Heart</em> Bezravnis explodes from the ground where it was summoned, causing all creatures in a 50-foot emanation to take 8d12 bludgeoning damage with a basic Reflex save. This potentially collapses structures with the collapse effect of the <em>earthquake</em> spell, except there is no chance of falling into a fissure; <strong>Depart</strong> <em>Web Hurricane</em> Bezravnis departs with a hurricane of webbing. All creatures within a 50-foot emanation must succeed at a Reflex save or take a –20-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until it Escapes (or is immobilized until it escapes on a critical failure). The Escape DC is your spell DC.</li>
  <li><strong>Mogaru, the Final King</strong> Speed 100 feet, swim 100 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> (auditory, enchantment, mental) <em>Trance of the King's Melody</em> Mogaru manifests with a burst of the song that summoned him, requiring all foes within 60 feet who can hear him to attempt a Will save, leaving them stunned 3 on a failure; <strong>Depart</strong> (evocation, fire) <em>Volcanic Breath</em> Mogaru unleashes his scorching breath in a 120-foot cone. Each creature in the area takes 10d6 fire damage with a basic Reflex save. On a failure, it also takes 4d6 persistent fire damage.</li>
  <li><strong>Vorgozen, the Shapeless Feeder</strong> Speed 50 feet, climb 50 feet, swim 100 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> (necromancy) <em>Pollute Magic</em> Vorgozen's foul presence pollutes magic around her. Each of your enemies within a 60-foot emanation that are under the effects of a spell must attempt a Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature is sickened 2. Any of your enemies that Casts a Spell within 60 feet of Vorgozen must attempt a Fortitude save with the same effects unless it's already sickened; <strong>Depart</strong> (acid, evocation) <em>Beam of Purest Vitriol</em> Each creature in a 1,200-foot line takes 10d6 acid damage and 10d6 bludgeoning damage with a basic Fortitude save.</li>
  <li><strong>Yarthoon, the Moon Grub</strong> Speed 60 feet, burrow 100 feet, fly 100 feet, swim 100 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> (cold, evocation) <em>Algid Beam Barrage</em> Yarthoon fires countless beams, targeting each of your enemies within 200 feet of it. The beams deal 10d6 cold damage with a basic Reflex save; <strong>Depart</strong> (cold, conjuration, water) <em>Frostbite Mist</em> Chilling mist surges out in a 100-foot burst centered on Yarthoon and remains for 1 minute. This mist has the effects of <em>obscuring mist</em>, plus any creature within the area at the end of its turn take 5d6 cold damage with a basic Fortitude save.</li>
  <li><strong>Ebeshra, the Winged Razor</strong> Speed 75 feet, fly 100 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> (conjuration, teleportation) <em>Planar Draw</em> Each foe in a 100-foot emanation is pulled 50 feet towards the center, unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save. Creatures that fail and reach the center take 10d6 bludgeoning damage; <strong>Depart</strong> (electricity, evocation) <em>Storm Discharge</em> Each foe in a 240-foot line takes 12d8 electricity damage with a basic Reflex save</li>
