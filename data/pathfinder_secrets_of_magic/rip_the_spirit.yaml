  <p>You supernaturally rip the spirit from a living creature's body, dooming the target to pain and death. The target takes 5d6 negative damage, depending on its basic Fortitude save, and is drained 1 if it fails its save. The spell's effect is based on how many actions you spend when Casting the Spell.</p>
  <p>[one-action] <strong>(somatic)</strong> The spell targets one living creature in range.</p>
  <p>[two-actions] <strong>(somatic, verbal)</strong> The spell targets one living creature in range and the damage is 10d6 negative instead of 5d6.</p>
  <p>[three-actions] <strong>(material, somatic, verbal)</strong> The spell targets all living creatures in a 30-foot emanation.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The amount of damage increases by 1d6, or by 2d6 for the 2-action version.</p>
