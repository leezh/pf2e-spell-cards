  <p>You fire a ray of heat and flame. Make a spell attack roll against a single creature. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 fire damage, and on a critical hit, the target takes double damage.</p>
  <p>For each additional action you use when Casting the Spell, you can fire an additional ray at a different target, to a maximum of three rays targeting three different targets for 3 actions. These attacks each increase your multiple attack penalty, but you don't increase your multiple attack penalty until after you make all the spell attack rolls for <em>scorching ray</em>. If you spend 2 or more actions Casting the Spell, the damage increases to 4d6 fire damage on a hit, and it still deals double damage on a critical hit.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage to each target increases by 1d6 for the 1-action version, or by 2d6 for the 2-action and 3-action versions.</p>
