  <p class="hanging-indent cast"><strong>Cast</strong> somatic, verbal</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> 120 feet; <strong>Area</strong> two 10-foot bursts that don't overlap</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent defense"><strong>Defense</strong> basic Reflex; <strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>Razor sharp coral growths erupt from the ground, transforming the landscape into a dangerous coral reef. You can create a third nonoverlapping burst if the centers of all three bursts are underwater. Creatures in the area when the spell is cast take 6d6 piercing damage and must attempt a basic Reflex save. A creature that critically fails its saving throw also takes 1d6 persistent bleed damage. The area becomes difficult terrain and hazardous terrain.</p>
  <p>A creature that moves through the area takes 3 piercing damage for every square of that area it moves into.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> The initial piercing damage increases by 3d6, and the hazardous terrain damage increases by 1.</p>
