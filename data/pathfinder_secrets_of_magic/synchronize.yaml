  <p>You harmlessly place your unique magic sigil, which is about 1 square inch in size, on your targets. When you Cast the Spell, you set the duration by choosing a time at which point the sigil flashes dimly three times. After that point, the spell ends. Even though spell durations aren't normally exact, the effects of <em>synchronize</em> are precise to the second. The timer is based on the place where the spell was cast, so entering a plane or area where time flows differently changes how the time elapses.</p>

  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (2nd)</strong> The spell can target up to 20 willing creatures.</p>
