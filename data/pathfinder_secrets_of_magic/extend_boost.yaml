  <hr/>
  <p>You focus on the intricacies of the magic binding you to your eidolon to extend the duration of your <em>boost eidolon</em> or <em>reinforce eidolon</em> spell. If your next action is to cast <em>boost eidolon</em> or <em>reinforce eidolon</em>, attempt a skill check with the skill associated with the tradition of magic you gain from your eidolon (such as Nature for a primal eidolon). The DC is usually a standard-difficulty DC of your level, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances. The effect depends on the result of your check.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Success</strong> The spell lasts 4 rounds.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The spell lasts 3 rounds.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> The spell lasts 1 round, but you don't spend the Focus Point for casting this spell.</p>
