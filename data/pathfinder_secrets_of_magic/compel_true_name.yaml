  <p class="hanging-indent cast"><strong>Cast</strong> verbal</p>

  <hr/>
  <p>You instruct the target to do something, compelling obedience by calling it by its true name. Your instructions can't be self-destructive. Though this spell has the linguistic trait, this applies only to the instructions; the creature doesn't need to know its own true name to be affected. The target must attempt a Will saving throw.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected, is temporarily immune to further castings of this spell by you for 1 week, and learns your true name.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The target is unaffected, is temporarily immune to further castings of this spell by you for 1 day, and learns a fragment of your true name (see the Fragmentary Names sidebar).</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> The target does as you command. The spell has a duration of 10 minutes, or until the target has completed a finite instruction or the instructions become self-destructive. The creature is temporarily immune to further castings of this spell by you for 1 hour.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the spell's duration is 8 hours, and the creature is not temporarily immune.</p>
