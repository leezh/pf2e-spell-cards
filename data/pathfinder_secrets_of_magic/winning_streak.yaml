  <p>The target is energized by its good fortune as it spreads to others—as long as they keep winning. It gains the quickened condition for 1 round. If the target or one of their allies within 20 feet gets a critical success on an attack roll against a significant foe, whoever got the critical success becomes quickened if they weren't already, and the duration of the <em>winning streak</em> is extended by another round. Creatures quickened by the spell can use the extra action to Strike, Step, or Stride. If a full round passes without the target or one their allies critically succeeding on an attack roll against a significant foe, the <em>winning streak</em> breaks and the spell ends.</p>
