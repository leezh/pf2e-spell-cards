  <p>You create a shimmering barrier that attempts to counteract teleportation effects and planar travel into or out of the area, including items that allow access to extradimensional spaces (such as a <em>bag of holding</em>). <em>Dimensional lock</em> tries to counteract any attempt to summon a creature into the area but doesn't stop the creature from departing when the summoning ends.</p>
