  <hr/>
  <p>You gain a vague glimpse of the future. During the casting of this spell, ask about the results of a particular course of action. The spell can predict results up to 30 minutes into the future and reveals the GM's best guess among the following outcomes:</p>
  <p>The GM rolls a secret DC 6 flat check. On a failure, the result is always “nothing.” This makes it impossible to tell whether a “nothing” result is accurate. If anyone asks about the same topic as the first casting of <em>augury</em> during an additional casting, the GM uses the secret roll result from the first casting. If circumstances change, though, it's possible to get a different result.</p>
  <li><strong>Nothing</strong> There won't be particularly good or bad results.</li>
  <li><strong>Weal and Woe</strong> The results will be a mix of good and bad.</li>
  <li><strong>Woe</strong> The results will be bad.</li>
  <li><strong>Weal</strong> The results will be good.</li>
