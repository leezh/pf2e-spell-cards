  <p class="hanging-indent cast"><strong>Cast</strong> verbal</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> 30 feet; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 creature that isn't holy</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent defense"><strong>Defense</strong> Will; <strong>Duration</strong> 1 round</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>Your litany rails against the sin of wrath, punishing the target for attacking good creatures. The target must attempt a Will save. A particularly wrathful creature, such as a wrath demon, uses the outcome one degree of success worse than the result of its saving throw. The target then becomes temporarily immune to all of your litanies for 1 minute.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The first time the target uses an action that deals damage to at least one creature that isn't unholy, the target takes 3d6 spirit damage.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> Each time the target uses an action that deals damage to at least one creature that isn't unholy, the target takes 3d6 spirit damage.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The target is enfeebled 2. Each time it uses an action that deals damage to at least one creature that isn't unholy, the target takes 3d6 spirit damage.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by 1d6.</p>
