  <p>Powerful wards hide a creature from divination magic. The target gains a +4 status bonus to saves against mental effects. <em>Mind blank</em> attempts to counteract any detection, revelation, and scrying effects as if its spell level were 1 higher than its actual level. On a success, the divination effect functions normally except that it detects nothing about the target and its possessions. For instance, <em>detect magic</em> would still detect other magic in the area, but not any magic on the target.</p>
