  <p class="hanging-indent traditions"><strong>Traditions</strong> arcane, occult</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent cast"><strong>Cast</strong> material, somatic, verbal</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> 120 feet</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent duration"><strong>Duration</strong> 10 minutes</p>

  <p>You create an opaque wall of light in a single vibrant color. The wall is straight and vertical, stretching 60 feet long and 30 feet high. If the wall would pass through a creature, the spell is lost. The wall sheds bright light for 20 feet on each side, and dim light for the next 20 feet. You can ignore the wall's effects.</p>
  <p>Roll 1d4 to determine the color of the wall. Each color has a particular effect on items, effects, or creatures that attempt to pass through. <em>Chromatic wall</em> can't be counteracted normally; rather, each color is automatically counteracted when targeted by a specific spell, even if that spell's level is lower than that of <em>chromatic wall</em>.</p>
  <li><strong>Green</strong> The wall stops toxins, gases, and breath weapons from passing through. It deals 10 poison damage to anyone passing through and makes them enfeebled 1 for 1 minute. A basic Fortitude save reduces the damage and negates the enfeebled condition on a success. <em>Passwall</em> can counteract a green <em>chromatic wall</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Yellow</strong> The wall stops acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, negative, positive, and sonic effects from passing through, and it deals 30 electricity damage to anyone passing through, with a basic Reflex save. <em>Disintegrate</em> can counteract a yellow <em>chromatic wall</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Orange</strong> The wall destroys thrown weapons that would pass through, and it deals 25 acid damage to anyone passing through, with a basic Reflex save. <em>Gust of wind</em> can counteract an orange <em>chromatic wall</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Red</strong> The wall destroys ranged weapon ammunition (such as arrows and crossbow bolts) that would pass through, and it deals 20 fire damage to anyone passing through, with a basic Reflex save. <em>Cone of cold</em> can counteract a red <em>chromatic wall</em>.</li>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (7th)</strong> The spell's duration increases to 1 hour. Roll 1d8 to determine the wall's color; the results for 5–8 are below. A red, orange, yellow, or green wall deals an extra 10 damage.</p>
  <li>Reroll, and creatures that pass through the wall take a –2 circumstance penalty to their saves.</li>
  <li><strong>Violet</strong> The wall prevents spells from targeting the other side (area effects still cross as normal). Creatures passing through must succeed at a Will save or they are slowed 1 for 1 minute; on a critical failure, the creature is instead sent to another plane, with the effect of <em>plane shift</em> . <em>Dispel magic</em> can counteract a violet <em>chromatic wall</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Indigo</strong> The wall stops divination and mental effects from passing through, and those passing through are subject to the effects of <em>warp mind</em>. <em>Searing light</em> can counteract an indigo <em>chromatic wall</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Blue</strong> The wall stops auditory, petrification, sonic, and visual effects from passing through, and creatures passing through are subject to the effects of <em>flesh to stone</em>. <em>Magic missile</em> can counteract a blue <em>chromatic wall</em>.</li>
