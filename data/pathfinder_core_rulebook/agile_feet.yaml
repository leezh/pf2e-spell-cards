  <p>The blessings of your god make your feet faster and your movements more fluid. You gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speed and ignore difficult terrain. As part of casting <em>agile feet</em>, you can Stride or Step; you can instead Burrow, Climb, Fly, or Swim if you have the appropriate Speed.</p>
