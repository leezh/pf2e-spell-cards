  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> varies; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 living creature or 1 willing undead creature</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You channel negative energy to harm the living or heal the undead. If the target is a living creature, you deal 1d8 negative damage to it, and it gets a basic Fortitude save. If the target is a willing undead creature, you restore that amount of Hit Points. The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell determines its targets, range, area, and other parameters.</p>
  <p>[one-action] <strong>(somatic)</strong> The spell has a range of touch.</p>
  <p>[two-actions] <strong>(somatic, verbal)</strong> The spell has a range of 30 feet. If you're healing an undead creature, increase the Hit Points restored by 8.</p>
  <p>[three-actions] <strong>(material, somatic, verbal)</strong> You disperse negative energy in a 30-foot emanation. This targets all living and undead creatures in the area.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The amount of healing or damage increases by 1d8, and the extra healing for the 2-action version increases by 8.</p>
