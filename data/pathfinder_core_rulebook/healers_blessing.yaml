  <p>Your words bless a creature with an enhanced connection to positive energy. When the target regains Hit Points from a healing spell, it regains 2 additional Hit Points.</p>
  <p>The target regains additional Hit Points from healer's blessing only the first time it regains HP from a given healing spell, so a spell that heals the creature repeatedly over a duration would restore additional Hit Points only once.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The additional healing increases by 2 HP.</p>
