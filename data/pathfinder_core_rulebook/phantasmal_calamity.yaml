  <hr/>
  <p>A vision of apocalyptic destruction fills the mind of each creature in the area. The vision deals 11d6 mental damage (basic Will save). On a critical failure, the creature must also succeed at a Reflex save or believe it's trapped (stuck in a fissure, adrift at sea, or some other fate in keeping with its vision). If it fails the second save, it's also stunned for 1 minute. It can attempt a new Will save at the end of each of its turns, and on a success, it disbelieves the illusion and recovers from the stunned condition.</p>

  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by 2d6.</p>
