  <hr/>
  <p>Holding your weapon aloft, you fill it with divine energy. On your next Strike with that weapon before the start of your next turn, you gain a +1 status bonus to the attack roll and the weapon deals an additional die of damage. If the weapon has a <em>striking</em> rune, this instead increases the number of dice from the <em>striking</em> rune by 1 (to a maximum of 3 extra weapon dice).</p>
  <p>If the target weapon leaves your possession, <em>weapon surge</em> immediately ends.</p>
