  <p>You use your occult lore and the power of your mind to manipulate the spiritual multiverse, resulting in any of the following effects:</p>
  <p>At the GM's discretion, you can try to produce greater effects, but this is dangerous and the spell may have only a partial effect.</p>
  <li>Reverse certain effects that refer to the <em>wish</em> spell</li>
  <li>Produce any effect whose power is equivalent to any occult spell 9th level or lower, or non-occult spell 7th level or lower.</li>
  <li>Duplicate any spell from another spell list of 7th level or lower. It must be common or you must have access.</li>
  <li>Duplicate any spell from the occult list of 9th level or lower to which you have access.</li>
