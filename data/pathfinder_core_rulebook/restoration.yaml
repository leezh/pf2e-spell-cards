  <p>Restorative magic counters the effects of toxins or conditions that prevent a creature from functioning at its best. When you cast <em>restoration</em>, choose to either reduce a condition or lessen the effect of a toxin. A creature can benefit from only one <em>restoration</em> spell each day, and it can't benefit from <em>restoration</em> more than once to reduce the stage of the same exposure to a given toxin.</p>
  <li><strong>Reduce a Condition</strong> Reduce the value of the target's clumsy, enfeebled, or stupefied condition by 2. You can instead reduce two of the listed conditions by 1 each.</li>
  <li><strong>Lessen a Toxin</strong> Reduce the stage of one toxin the target suffers from by one stage. This can't reduce the stage below stage 1 or cure the affliction.</li>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (4th)</strong> Add drained to the list of conditions you can reduce. When you lessen a toxin, reduce the stage by two. You also gain a third option that allows you to reduce the target's doomed value by 1. You can't use this to reduce a permanent doomed condition.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (6th)</strong> As the 4th-level <em>restoration</em>, but you can reduce a permanent doomed condition if you add a spellcasting action and a material component while Casting the Spell, during which you provide 100 gp worth of diamond dust as a cost.</p>
