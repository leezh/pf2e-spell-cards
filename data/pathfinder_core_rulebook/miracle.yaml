  <p>You request aid directly from your divine source. Your divine source always refuses a request out of line with its nature, and it might grant a different request (potentially more powerful or better fitting its nature) than the one you asked for. A casting of <em>miracle</em> can do any of the following things.</p>
  <p>The GM might allow you to try using <em>miracle</em> to produce greater effects than these, but doing so may be dangerous, or the spell may have only a partial effect.</p>
  <li>Reverse certain effects that refer to the <em>wish</em> spell.</li>
  <li>Produce any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.</li>
  <li>Duplicate any spell from another spell list of 7th level or lower. It must be common or you must have access.</li>
  <li>Duplicate any spell from the divine list of 9th level or lower to which you have access.</li>
