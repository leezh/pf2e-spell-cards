  <p>Your litany rails against the sin of sloth, interfering with the target's ability to react. The target must attempt a Will save. A particularly slothful creature, such as a Sloth Demon, uses the outcome one degree of success worse than the result of its saving throw. The target becomes temporarily immune to all of your litanies for 1 minute.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The target can't use reactions.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> The target can't use reactions and is slowed 1.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The target can't use reactions and is slowed 2.</p>
