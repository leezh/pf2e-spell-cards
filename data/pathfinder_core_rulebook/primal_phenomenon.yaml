  <p>You request a direct intercession from the natural world. Nature always refuses unnatural requests and might grant a different request (potentially more powerful or better fitting its character) than the one you asked for. A <em>primal phenomenon</em> spell can do any of the following things.</p>
  <p>At the GM's discretion, you can try to use <em>primal phenomenon</em> to produce greater effects than these, but doing so may be dangerous, or the spell may have only a partial effect.</p>
  <li>Reverse certain effects that refer to the <em>wish</em> spell.</li>
  <li>Produce any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.</li>
  <li>Duplicate any spell from another spell list of 7th level or lower. It must be common or you must have access.</li>
  <li>Duplicate any spell from the primal list of 9th level or lower to which you have access.</li>
