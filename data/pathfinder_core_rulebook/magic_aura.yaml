  <p>You alter the appearance of an item's magic aura. You can choose to have the target's aura appear as that of a common magic item of twice <em>magic aura</em>'s level or lower, or to have it register as being under the effects of a spell of your choice of <em>magic aura</em>'s level or lower. If the target is magical, you can instead choose to have it appear as entirely non-magical.</p>
