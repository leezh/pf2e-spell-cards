  <p class="hanging-indent traditions"><strong>Traditions</strong> arcane, divine, occult</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent cast"><strong>Cast</strong> 10 minutes (material, somatic, verbal)</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> unlimited; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 creature or object</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You learn the name of the target's exact location (including the building, community, and country) and plane of existence.</p>
  <p>You can target a creature only if you've seen it in person, have one of its significant belongings, or have a piece of its body. To target an object, you must have touched it or have a fragment of it. <em>Discern location</em> automatically overcomes protections against detection and divination of lower level than this spell, even if they would normally have a chance to block it.</p>
