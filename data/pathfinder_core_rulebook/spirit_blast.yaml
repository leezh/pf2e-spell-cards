  <p>You concentrate ethereal energy and attack a creature's spirit, dealing 16d6 force damage. Because <em>spirit blast</em> affects the creature's spirit, it can damage a target projecting its consciousness (such as via <em>project image</em>) or possessing another creature even if the target's body is elsewhere. The possessed creature isn't harmed by the blast. The blast doesn't harm creatures that have no spirit, such as constructs.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by 2d6.</p>
