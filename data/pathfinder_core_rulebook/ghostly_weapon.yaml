  <p>The target weapon becomes translucent and ghostly, and it can affect material and incorporeal creatures and objects. It can be wielded by a corporeal or incorporeal creature and gains the effects of the <em>ghost touch</em> property rune. If the weapon is magical and already has the maximum number of property runes, the wielder can choose one to suppress to gain <em>ghost touch</em>.</p>
