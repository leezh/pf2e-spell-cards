  <p>The target appears to be a gruesome and terrifying creature. The effect is unique to each observer, so a human viewing the target might see a demon with bloody fangs, but a demon observing the target might see a glowing angelic visage.</p>
  <p>When any creature attempts a hostile action against the target, the creature must attempt a Will save. It is then temporarily immune until the end of its next turn.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> The creature becomes frightened 2 before using its action.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature becomes frightened 2, and its action fails and is wasted.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (8th)</strong> You can target up to 5 creatures. If a creature uses a hostile action or reaction that affects multiple targets simultaneously, it needs to attempt only one save against <em>mask of terror</em>.</p>
