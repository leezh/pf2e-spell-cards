  <p>Leathery wings sprout from your back, giving you a fly Speed of 60 feet or your Speed, whichever is faster. When this spell's duration would end, if you're still flying, you float to the ground, as <em>feather fall</em>. You can increase the Focus Point cost by 1 to gain the effects of <em>dragon claws</em> as long as the wings last.</p>
