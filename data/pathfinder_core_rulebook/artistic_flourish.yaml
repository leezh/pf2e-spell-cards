  <p class="hanging-indent cast"><strong>Cast</strong> material, somatic</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> 15 feet; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 item or work of art that fits entirely within the range</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent duration"><strong>Duration</strong> 10 minutes</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You transform the target to make it match your artisanal and artistic vision. If you have expert proficiency in Crafting, the item grants a +1 item bonus to attack rolls if it's a weapon or skill checks if it's a skill tool. The target is a beautiful and impressive piece for its new quality, but the effect is obviously temporary, so its monetary value doesn't change.</p>
  <p>When you cast this spell, any previous <em>artistic flourish</em> you had cast ends.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (7th)</strong> If you have master proficiency in Crafting, the item grants a +2 item bonus instead.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (10th)</strong> If you have legendary proficiency in Crafting, the item grants a +3 item bonus instead.</p>
