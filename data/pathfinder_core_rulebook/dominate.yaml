  <p class="hanging-indent traditions"><strong>Traditions</strong> arcane, occult</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent cast"><strong>Cast</strong> somatic, verbal</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> 30 feet; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 creature</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent defense"><strong>Defense</strong> Will; <strong>Duration</strong> until the next time you make your daily preparations</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You take command of the target, forcing it to obey your orders. If you issue an obviously self-destructive order, the target doesn't act until you issue a new order. The effect depends on its Will save.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The target is stunned 1 as it fights off your commands.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> You control the target. It gains the controlled condition, but it can attempt a Will save at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the spell ends.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As a failure, but the target receives a new save only if you give it a new order that is against its nature, such as killing its allies.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (10th)</strong> The duration is unlimited.</p>
