  <hr/>
  <p>A field of cascading, ever-changing colors manifests in the air. Creatures are dazzled while inside the pattern, as are those within 20 feet of the pattern's area. A creature must attempt a Will save if it is inside the pattern when you cast it, enters the pattern, ends its turn within the pattern, or uses a Seek or Interact action on the pattern. A creature currently affected by the pattern doesn't need to attempt new saves.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is confused for 1d4 rounds.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature is stunned for 1d4 rounds. After the stunned condition ends, the creature is confused for the remaining duration of the spell.</p>
