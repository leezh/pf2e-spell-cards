  <p>You conjure a fiend to fight on your behalf. This works like <em>summon animal</em>, except you summon a common creature that has the fiend trait and whose level is 5 or lower, such as those below. You can't summon a creature unless its alignment is one of your deity's preferred alignments (or, if you don't have a deity, is within one step of your alignment). At the GM's discretion, some deities might restrict specific types of fiends, even if their alignments match.</p>
