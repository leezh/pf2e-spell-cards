  <p>Blessings from beyond help your companions strike true. You and your allies gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls while within the emanation. Once per turn, starting the turn after you cast <em>bless</em>, you can use a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to increase the emanation's radius by 5 feet. <em>Bless</em> can counteract <em>bane</em>.</p>
