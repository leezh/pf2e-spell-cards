  <p>With soothing song or tales, you lull the target into an enchanting dream. When you cast the spell, the target falls unconscious if it wasn't already. While unconscious, it experiences a dream of your choice. If it sleeps for at least 1 minute, it gains the benefit of the dream for the remainder of the spell's duration.</p>
