  <p>You strengthen a target's ambition, increase its resentment of allies, and make its allegiances more susceptible to change. The target must attempt a Will save.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The target takes a –1 status penalty to its saving throws and other defenses against attempts to Coerce it, Request something of it, or use mental effects to convince it to do something (such as a <em>suggestion</em> spell). This penalty applies only if the target is being encouraged to advance its own ambitions.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Failure</strong> As success, but the penalty is –2.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The target is overcome with ambition, taking whatever actions would advance its own agenda over those of anyone else, even without attempts to convince it.</p>
