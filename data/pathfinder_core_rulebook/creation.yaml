  <p>You conjure a temporary object from eldritch energy. It must be of vegetable matter (such as wood or paper) and 5 cubic feet or smaller. It can't rely on intricate artistry or complex moving parts, never fulfills a cost or the like, and can't be made of precious materials or materials with a rarity of uncommon or higher. It is obviously temporarily conjured, and thus can't be sold or passed off as a genuine item.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (5th)</strong> The item is metal and can include common minerals, like feldspar or quartz.</p>
