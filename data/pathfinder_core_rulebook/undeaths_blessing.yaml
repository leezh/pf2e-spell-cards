  <p>You instill within a creature the touch of the grave. For the duration, <em>harm</em> and <em>heal</em> spells treat the creature as undead. In addition, <em>harm</em> spells gain a +2 status bonus to the Hit Points restored to the target.</p>
  <p>If the target wishes to avoid the spell, it can attempt a Will save to reduce the effects.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The target heals half as much from <em>heal</em> and takes half as much damage from <em>harm</em> for 1 round.</p>
