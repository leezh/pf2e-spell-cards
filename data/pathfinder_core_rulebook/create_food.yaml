  <p>You create enough food to feed six Medium creatures for a day. This food is bland and unappealing, but it is nourishing. After 1 day, if no one has eaten the food, it decays and becomes inedible. Most Small creatures eat one-quarter as much as a Medium creature (one-sixteenth as much for most Tiny creatures), and most Large creatures eat 10 times as much (100 times as much for Huge creatures and so on).</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (4th)</strong> You can feed 12 Medium creatures.</p>
