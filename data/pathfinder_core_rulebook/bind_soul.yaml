  <hr/>
  <p>You wrench the target's soul away before it can pass on to the afterlife and imprison it in a black sapphire.</p>
  <p>While the soul is in the gem, the target can't be returned to life through any means, even powerful magic such as <em>wish</em>. If the gem is destroyed or <em>bind soul</em> is counteracted on the gem, the soul is freed. The gem has AC 16 and Hardness 10. A gem can't hold more than one soul, and any attempt wastes the spell.</p>
