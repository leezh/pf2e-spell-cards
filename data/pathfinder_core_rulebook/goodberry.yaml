  <p class="hanging-indent cast"><strong>Cast</strong> somatic, verbal</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> touch; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 ripe berry</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent duration"><strong>Duration</strong> 10 minutes</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You imbue the target berry with the bounty of nature, turning it into a goodberry that can heal and sustain far beyond its normal capacity. A creature can eat the goodberry with an Interact action to regain 1d6+4 Hit Points. A berry not consumed during the duration withers away. Every six goodberries consumed gives as much nourishment as one square meal for a typical human.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> You can target an additional berry. A creature can consume any number of goodberries from the same casting with a single Interact action.</p>
