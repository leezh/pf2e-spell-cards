  <p>A small ball of flame appears in the palm of your hand, and you lash out with it either in melee or at range. Make a spell attack roll against your target's AC. This is normally a ranged attack, but you can also make a melee attack against a creature in your unarmed reach. The flame deals 2d4 fire damage.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target takes double damage and 1d4 persistent fire damage.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The target takes full damage.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> Increase the damage by 1d4 and the persistent damage on a critical hit by 1d4.</p>
