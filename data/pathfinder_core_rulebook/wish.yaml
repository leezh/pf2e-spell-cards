  <p>You state a wish, making your greatest desire come true. A wish spell can produce any one of the following effects.</p>
  <p>The GM might allow you to try using <em>wish</em> to produce greater effects than these, but doing so might be dangerous or the spell might have only a partial effect.</p>
  <li>Reverse certain effects that refer to the <em>wish</em> spell.</li>
  <li>Produce any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.</li>
  <li>Duplicate any spell from another spell list of 7th level or lower. It must be common or you must have access.</li>
  <li>Duplicate any spell from the arcane list of 9th level or lower to which you have access.</li>
