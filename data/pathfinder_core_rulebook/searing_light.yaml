  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> 120 feet; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 creature</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You shoot a blazing ray of light tinged with holy energy. Make a ranged spell attack. The ray deals 5d6 fire damage. If the target is a fiend or undead, you deal an extra 5d6 good damage.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target takes double fire damage, as well as double good damage if a fiend or undead.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Success</strong> The target takes full damage.</p>
  <p>If the light passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, <em>searing light</em> attempts to counteract the darkness. If you need to determine whether the light passes through an area of darkness, draw a line between yourself and the spell's target.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The fire damage increases by 2d6, and the good damage against fiends and undead increases by 2d6.</p>
