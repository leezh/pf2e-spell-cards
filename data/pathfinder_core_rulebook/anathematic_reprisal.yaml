  <p class="hanging-indent trigger"><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature performs an act anathema to your deity.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> 30 feet; <strong>Targets</strong> the triggering creature</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent defense"><strong>Defense</strong> Will</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You punish a creature that transgresses against your deity, drawing upon the anguish you feel upon seeing one of your deity's anathema committed.</p>
  <p>You can cast this spell only when a creature actively commits a unique act of anathema. For example, if creating undead were anathema to your deity, you could use <em>anathematic reprisal</em> on a necromancer who had just created undead in front of you, but not on an undead creature just for existing.</p>
  <p>You deal 4d6 mental damage to the target, but a basic Will save can reduce this damage. If it fails, it is also stupefied 1 for 1 round. The creature is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by 1d6.</p>
