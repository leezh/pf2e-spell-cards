  <p>Siphoning negative energy into yourself, your hand radiates a pale darkness. Your touch weakens the living and disorients undead, possibly even causing them to flee. The effect depends on whether the target is living or undead.</p>
  <li><strong>Living Creature</strong> The spell deals negative damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting modifier. The target attempts a basic Fortitude save, but is also enfeebled 1 for 1 round on a critical failure.</li>
  <li><strong>Undead Creature</strong> The target is flat-footed for 1 round on a failed Fortitude save. On a critical failure, the target is also fleeing for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Will save.</li>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The negative damage to living creatures increases by 1d4.</p>
