  <p>Nothing can hold you in place. You immediately escape from every magical effect that has you immobilized or grabbed unless the effect is of a higher level than your <em>unimpeded stride</em> spell. You then Stride. During this movement, you ignore difficult terrain and any circumstance or status penalties to your Speed.</p>
