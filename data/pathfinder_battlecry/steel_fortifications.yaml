  <p>You conjure several metal structures that consist of angled beams attached to one another at a central point, which can help block attacks. You create up to three Large structures within range in unoccupied squares; each fortification is 8 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 8 feet tall. There must be enough room for a fortification in order to conjure it. A single fortification has an AC of 10 and is immune to critical hits and precision damage. It has Hardness 9, 60 Hit Points, and a BT of 30. Once a fortification is broken, it crumbles into sharp metal bits. Any creature adjacent to or sharing a space with a fortification when it is broken must attempt a Reflex save or take 2d6 persistent bleed damage.</p>
  <p>Creatures can pass through the spaces of a fortification, though Medium and larger creatures treat these spaces as difficult terrain. A Small or smaller creature can occupy the same spaces as a fortification; doing so grants them standard cover. Similarly, a prone Medium creature can occupy the same spaces as a fortification, gaining standard cover in the process. A Medium or smaller creature can climb a fortification with a successful DC 15 Athletics check.</p>
