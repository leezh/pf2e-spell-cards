  <p class="hanging-indent trigger"><strong>Trigger</strong> A shield within range would be reduced to 0 Hit Points by a damaging effect</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent requirements"><strong>Requirements</strong> The triggering shield had more than 1 Hit Point before taking damage.</p>
  <p class="hanging-indent range"><strong>Range</strong> 60 feet; <strong>Targets</strong> 1 shield</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>You hold a shield together with the power of your magic, forcing wood and steel to fuse back together. The shield remains at 1 Hit Point and isn’t destroyed. Its construction is weakened until someone takes the time to repair it, preventing desperate repair or a similar ability from saving the same shield until your next daily preparations.</p>
