  <hr/>
  <p>You conjure a vicious barbed spear and hurl it at a foe. Make a ranged spell attack roll, dealing 1d8 piercing damage on a success and double damage on a critical success. The spear remains lodged within a creature it hits, making the target clumsy 1 (or increasing its clumsy condition by 1 if it is already clumsy) for 1 minute or until the spear is removed with a successful Athletics check against your spell DC as an Interact action, whichever comes first.</p>

  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The initial damage increases by 1d8.</p>
