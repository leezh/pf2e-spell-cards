  <p>Sometimes the most common irritations can band together and become threats to your enemies. You reach out to the pests and nuisances around you, forming a small squadron of them to harass and occupy your opponents. They swarm from the forests, the air, and even the dirt beneath your feet. The pest squadron occupies the space of a Large creature, and like a swarm, they can occupy the same space as other creatures. When you Cast this Spell, choose one of the pest squadrons below to summon.</p>
  <li><strong>Cockroaches</strong> Speed 30 feet, climb 30 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> <em>Scurrying Swarm</em> The swarm of cockroaches scuttles toward the enemy, swarming them and climbing up the bodies of any enemy touching the ground. They deal 4d6 piercing damage (basic Reflex save) to all enemies within their space and in a 5-foot emanation. On a critical failure, a creature can't use concentrate actions for 1 round as they try and brush away the insects; <strong>Depart</strong> <em>Farewell Dirt</em> The cockroaches disperse, climbing down from the creatures and leaving behind their debris and dirt. All enemies in their space must attempt a Fortitude save. On a failure, a creature is sickened 2 (sickened 3 on a critical failure).</li>
  <li><strong>Mosquitoes</strong> Speed 30 feet, fly 50 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> <em>Biting Flight</em> The mosquitoes arrive in a hazy cloud, landing on the exposed skin of your opponents and dealing 4d6 piercing damage to enemies in their space (basic Reflex save); <strong>Depart</strong> <em>Parting Gift</em> The swarm attempts to drain their opponents before flying off. All enemies in their space and in a 5-foot emanation must succeed at a Fortitude save or become drained 1 (drained 2 on a critical failure).</li>
  <li><strong>Pigeons</strong> Speed 20 feet, fly 40 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> <em>Dive Bomb</em> The swarm of pigeons dives into the crowd of enemies and attacks with beaks and talons. Each enemy within their space takes 2d8 piercing and 2d4 slashing damage (basic Reflex save). On a critical failure, a creature is dazzled for 1 round; <strong>Depart</strong> (sonic) <em>Wing Snap</em> The pigeon swarm snaps their wingtips together to startle their opponents before leaving. Each enemy within their space takes 4d6 sonic damage (basic Fortitude save).</li>
  <li><strong>Rats</strong> Speed 30 feet, burrow 20 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> <em>Chittering Race</em> Rats swarm the legs of your enemies, biting at them and digging their sharp nails into whatever exposed flesh reveals itself. Each enemy in their space takes 4d6 piercing damage (basic Reflex save); <strong>Depart</strong> <em>Underfoot</em> The rats scurry underfoot, tripping up enemies and burrowing underground to make a swift getaway. Each enemy in their space must succeed a Reflex save or be knocked prone and take 2d6 bludgeoning damage. The area the rat swarm was in becomes difficult terrain for 1 round.</li>
  <li><strong>Skunks</strong> Speed 30 feet, climb 20 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> <em>Mustelid Charge</em> Skunks race to the scene, and each enemy within their space and within a 5-foot emanation take 4d6 piercing damage (basic Reflex save) as the skunks snarl and bite; <strong>Depart</strong> (acid) <em>Stink Bomb</em> Before leaving, the skunks launch a final offensive maneuver and release their stink glands in a 15-foot cone. All creatures in the area take 2d6 acid damage (basic Fortitude save). On a failure, a creature is also sickened 1 (sickened 2 on a critical failure).</li>
  <li><strong>Spiders</strong> Speed 30 feet, climb 30 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> (poison) <em>Venomous Swarm</em> horde of violin spiders crawls up from the ground, climbing onto enemies within their space and in a 5-foot emanation and biting them. Each enemy takes 3d6 piercing damage (basic Fortitude save). Enemies who fail are exposed to violin spider venom; <strong>Depart</strong> <em>Spinning Webs</em> As the violin spiders depart, they spray sticky webs at their enemies in a 30-foot cone. All creatures in this cone must attempt a Reflex save. On a failure, a creature takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to their Speeds (–20-foot circumstance penalty on a critical failure) for 1 minute; a creature can remove this penalty with a successful Escape against your spell DC. The area of the cone is also difficult terrain for 1 round.</li>
  <p class="indent hanging-indent"><strong>Violin Spider Venom</strong> (poison) <strong>Saving Throw</strong> DC 24 Fortitude; <strong>Maximum Duration</strong> 6 rounds; <strong>Stage 1</strong> 1d6 poison (1 round); <strong>Stage 2</strong> 2d6 poison and clumsy 1 (1 round); <strong>Stage 3</strong> 2d6 poison, 1d6 persistent bleed, and clumsy 1 (1 round); Stage 4 2d6 poison, 2d6 persistent bleed, and clumsy 1 (1 round)</p>
