  <hr/>
  <p>You fire a booming, fiery explosion followed by a salvo of smaller blasts, each cracking the air with the sound of thunder. You create a 20-foot burst and 1d4 additional 5-foot bursts each within the range and within 20 feet of another burst. None of the bursts can intersect. Each creature caught in at least one of these bursts takes 6d8 fire damage and 6d4 sonic damage (basic Fortitude save). On a failed save, a creature is also deafened for 1 minute.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The fire damage increases by 1d8 and the sonic damage increases by 1d4.</p>
