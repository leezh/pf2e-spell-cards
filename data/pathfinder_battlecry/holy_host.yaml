  <p>In stories, armies with just and righteous causes win with little difficulty, conquering unholy legions. However, many holy armies know that an extra hand never hurts in the fight to exterminate cruelty and unholy forces, and they might call upon the assistance of a holy army. The holy army occupies the space of a Huge creature. When you Cast this Spell, choose one of the holy militaries below to summon.</p>
  <li><strong>Agathions</strong> Speed 30 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> (fire) <em>Pranks for All</em> A squadron of procyals arrives, eager to see your enemies learn their lesson in this fight. All enemies in a 60-foot cone take 8d6 fire damage (basic Reflex save) as the procyals bombard them with popping firecrackers; <strong>Depart</strong> <em>Parting Lesson</em> (emotion, mental) The procyals laugh uproariously as they leave, each throwing out a piece of unrelated advice to a nearby enemy. Enemies in a 20-foot emanationtake 4d6 mental damage (basic Will save). On a failure, a creature is also stunned 1. On a critical failure, they're stunned 2.</li>
  <li><strong>Angels</strong> Speed 30 feet, fly 40 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> (spirit) <em>FlamingTruth</em> A legion of balisses arrive in a burst of holy flame, dealing 8d6 spirit damage to all creatures in a 20-foot emanation with a basic Fortitude save. On a critical failure, a creature is also blinded for 1 round; <strong>Depart</strong> <em>Hidden Departure</em> With a plume of smoke, the balisses vanish, spreading a thick cloud of smoke in a 10-foot emanation. All creatures within the smoke are concealed. Unholy creatures within the smoke are enfeebled 2, and holy creatures within the smoke gain the effects of <em>truesight</em> and ignore the concealment granted by the smoke.</li>
  <li><strong>Archons</strong> Speed 30 feet, fly 60 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> (spirit) <em>Justice Prevails</em> battalion of aesras, also known as legion archons, swoop in to provide assistance. Enemies within a 60-foot cone take 8d6 spirit damage (basic Reflex save); <strong>Depart</strong> (fire) <em>Eyes of Judgment</em> With one final examination of the battlefield, the aesras take their leave, but not before bringing down their fiery swords to create a corridor of sacred flame. Enemies in a 60-foot line take 4d6 slashing damage and 2d6 persistent fire damage (basic Reflex save).</li>
  <li><strong>Azatas</strong> Speed 30 feet, fly 80 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> (auditory, sonic) <em>Inspiring Song</em> Kanya muses arrive to embolden your allies while pushing back your foes. Enemies in a 20-foot emanation take 6d6 sonic damage (basic Fortitude save). A creature that fails the save is also pushed 10 feet away from the kanyas. Allies in the emanation gain a +2 status bonus to attack rolls and saving throws, as well as +4 status bonus to damage rolls for the duration of the spell; <strong>Depart</strong> (emotion, fear, mental) <em>Booming Finale</em> With a thunderous chord that stirs the hearts of your forces, the kanyas depart. Enemies in a 60-foot cone must attempt a Will save. On a failure, they're frightened 2, and on a critical failure, they're frightened 3 and deafened for 1 round. Allies in this cone regain 4d10+16 Hit Points.</li>
  <li><strong>Garudas</strong> Speed 25 feet, fly 60 feet; <strong>Arrive</strong> <em>Swooping Dive</em> A battalion of garudas sweep through enemy lines, dealing 6d10 slashing damage to enemies in a 120-foot line (basic Reflex save); <strong>Depart</strong> <em>Winds of Freedom</em> The garudas flap their wings in tandem, focusing on a 20-foot burst within 60 feet of them. All allies in that area gain a +1 circumstance bonus to all skill checks and DCs for 1 round, and enemies must succeed a Reflex save or be knocked prone.</li>
